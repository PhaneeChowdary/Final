      "Miss Thangue, who had never seen her friend's hand tremble among the\n",
      "teacups before, felt an edge on her mental appetite, stimulating after\n",
      "two monotonous years abroad. It was several minutes, however, before she\n",
      "made any effort to relieve her curiosity, for of all her patron-friends\n",
      "Victoria Gwynne required the most delicate touch. Flora had learned to\n",
      "be audacious without taking a liberty, which, indeed, was one secret of\n",
      "her success; but although she prided herself upon her reading of this\n",
      "enigma, whom even the ancestral dames of Capheaton looked down upon\n",
      "inspectively, she was never quite sure of her ground. She particularly\n",
      "wished to avoid mistakes upon the renewal of an intimacy kept alive by a\n",
      "fitful correspondence during her sojourn on the Continent. Quite apart\n",
      "from self-interest, she liked no one as well, and her curiosity was\n",
      "tempered by a warm sympathy and a genuine interest. It was this capacity\n",
      "for friendship, and her unlimited good-nature, that had saved her,\n",
      "penniless as she was, from the ignominious footing of the social\n",
      "parasite. The daughter of a clergyman in a Yorkshire village, and the\n",
      "playmate in childhood of the little girls of the castle near by, she had\n",
      "realized early in life that although pretty and well-bred, she was not\n",
      "yet sufficiently dowered by either nature or fortune to hope for a\n",
      "brilliant marriage; and she detested poverty. Upon her father's death\n",
      "she must earn her bread, and, reasoning that self-support was merely the\n",
      "marketing of one's essential commodity, and as her plump and indolent\n",
      "body was disinclined to privations of any sort, she elected the role of\n",
      "useful friend to fashionable and luxurious women. It was not an exalted\n",
      "niche to fill in life, but at least she had learned to fill it to\n",
      "perfection, and her ambitions were modest. Moreover, a certain integrity\n",
      "of character and girlish enthusiasm had saved her from the more\n",
      "corrosive properties of her anomalous position, and she was not only\n",
      "clever enough to be frankly useful without servility, but she had become\n",
      "so indispensable to certain of her friends, that although still blooming\n",
      "in her early forties, she would no more have deserted them for a mere\n",
      "husband than she would have renounced her comfortable and varied\n",
      "existence for the no less varied uncertainties of matrimony.\n",
      "It was not often that a kindly fate had overlooked her for so long a\n",
      "period as two years, and when she had accepted the invitation of one of\n",
      "the old castle playmates to visit her in Florence, it had been with a\n",
      "lively anticipation that made dismay the more poignant in the face of\n",
      "hypochondria. Nevertheless, realizing her debt to this first of her\n",
      "patrons, and with much of her old affection revived, she wandered from\n",
      "one capital and specialist to the next, until death gave her liberty.\n",
      "She was not unrewarded, but the legacy inspired her with no desire for\n",
      "an establishment beyond her room at the Club in Dover Street, the\n",
      "companionship of friends not too exacting, the agreeable sense of\n",
      "indispensableness, and a certain splendor of environment which gave a\n",
      "warmth and color to life; and which she could not have commanded had she\n",
      "set up in middle years as an independent spinster of limited income. She\n",
      "had received many impatient letters while abroad, to which she had\n",
      "replied with fluent affection and picturesque gossip, never losing touch\n",
      "for a moment. When release came she had hastened home to book herself\n",
      "for the house-parties, and with Victoria Gwynne, although one of the\n",
      "least opulent of her friends, first on the list. She had had several\n",
      "correspondents as ardent as herself, and there was little gossip of the\n",
      "more intimate sort that had not reached her sooner or later, but she\n",
      "found subtle changes in Victoria for which she could not as yet account.\n",
      "She had now been at Capheaton and alone with her friend for three days,\n",
      "but there had been a stress of duties for both, and the hostess had\n",
      "never been more silent. To-day, as she seemed even less inclined to\n",
      "conversation, although manifestly nervous, Miss Thangue merely drank her\n",
      "tea with an air of being too comfortable and happy in England and\n",
      "Capheaton for intellectual effort, and patiently waited for a cue or an\n",
      "inspiration. But although she too kept silence, memory and imagination\n",
      "held rendezvous in her circumspect brain, and she stole more than one\n",
      "furtive glance at her companion.\n",
      "Lady Victoria Gwynne, one of the tallest women of her time and still one\n",
      "of the handsomest, had been extolled all her life for that fusion of the\n",
      "romantic and the aristocratic ideals that so rarely find each other in\n",
      "the same shell; and loved by a few. Her round slender figure, supple\n",
      "with exercise and ignorant of disease, her black hair and eyes, the\n",
      "utter absence of color in her smooth Orientally white skin, the mouth,\n",
      "full at the middle and curving sharply upward at the corners, and the\n",
      "irregular yet delicate nose that seemed presented as an afterthought to\n",
      "save that brilliant and subtle face from classic severity, made her\n",
      "look--for the most part--as if fashioned for the picture-gallery or the\n",
      "poem, rather than for the commonplaces of life. Always one of those\n",
      "Englishwomen that let their energy be felt rather than expressed, for\n",
      "she made no effort in conversation whatever, her once mobile face had of\n",
      "late years, without aging, composed itself into a sort of illuminated\n",
      "mask. As far as possible removed from that other ideal, the British\n",
      "Matron, and still suggesting an untamed something in the complex centres\n",
      "of her character, she yet looked so aloof, so monumental, that she had\n",
      "recently been painted by a great artist for a world exhibition, as an\n",
      "illustration of what centuries of breeding and selection had done for\n",
      "the noblewomen of England.\n",
      "Some years before, a subtle Frenchman had expressed her in such a\n",
      "fashion that while many vowed he had given to the world an epitome of\n",
      "romantic youth, others remarked cynically that his handsome subject\n",
      "looked as if about to seat herself on the corner of the table and smoke\n",
      "a cigarette. The American artist, although habitually cruel to his\n",
      "patrons, had, after triumphantly transferring the type to the canvas,\n",
      "drawn to the surface only so much of the soul of the woman as all that\n",
      "ran might admire. If there was a hint of bitterness in the lower part of\n",
      "the face, from the eyes there looked an indomitable courage and much\n",
      "sweetness. Only in the carnage of the head, the tilt of the chin, was\n",
      "the insolence expressed that had made her many enemies. Some of the\n",
      "wildest stories of the past thirty years had been current about her, and\n",
      "rejected or believed according to the mental habit or personal bias of\n",
      "those that tinker with reputations. The late Queen, it was well known,\n",
      "had detested her, and made no secret of her resentment that through the\n",
      "short-sighted loyalty of one of the first members of her Household, the\n",
      "dangerous creature had been named after her. But whatever her secrets,\n",
      "open scandal Lady Victoria had avoided: imperturbably, without even an\n",
      "additional shade of insolence, never apologizing nor explaining;\n",
      "wherein, no doubt, lay one secret of her strength. And then her\n",
      "eminently respectable husband, Arthur Gwynne, second son of the Marquess\n",
      "of Strathland and Zeal, had always fondly alluded to her as \"The\n",
      "Missus,\" and lauded her as a repository of all the unfashionable\n",
      "virtues. To-day, presiding at the tea-table in her son's country-house,\n",
      "an eager light in her eyes, she looked like neither of her portraits:\n",
      "more nearly approached, perhaps, poor Arthur Gwynne's ideal of her; not\n",
      "in the least the frozen stoic of the past three days. When she finally\n",
      "made an uncontrollable movement that half-overturned the cream-jug,\n",
      "Flora Thangue's curiosity overcame her, and she murmured, tentatively:\n",
      "\"If I had ever seen you nervous before, Vicky--\"\n",
      "\"I am not nervous, but allowances are to be made for maternal anxiety.\"\n",
      "\"Oh!\" Miss Thangue drew a deep breath. She continued, vaguely, \"Oh, the\n",
      "maternal role--\"\n",
      "\"Have I ever failed as a mother?\" asked Lady Victoria, dispassionately.\n",
      "\"No, but you are so many other things, too. Somehow, when I am away from\n",
      "you I see you in almost every other capacity.\"\n",
      "\"Jack is thirty and I am forty-nine.\"\n",
      "\"_You_ look thirty,\" replied Flora, with equal candor.\n",
      "\"I am thankful that my age is in Lodge; I can never be tempted to enroll\n",
      "myself with the millions that were married when just sixteen.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, you never could make a fool of yourself,\" murmured her friend.\n",
      "Then, as Victoria showed signs of relapsing into silence, she plunged in\n",
      "recklessly; \"Jack is bound to be elected. When has he ever failed to get\n",
      "what he wanted? But you, Vicky dear--is there anything wrong? You had a\n",
      "bulky letter from California the day I arrived. I do hope that tiresome\n",
      "property is not giving you trouble. What a pity it is such a long way\n",
      "off.\"\n",
      "\"The San Francisco lease runs out shortly. Half of that, and the\n",
      "southern ranch, are my only independent sources of income. The northern\n",
      "ranch belongs to Jack. All three are getting less and less easy to let\n",
      "in their entirety, my agents write me, and I feel half a pauper\n",
      "already.\"\n",
      "\"This is not so bad,\" murmured Flora.\n",
      "\"Strathland would bundle me out in ten minutes if anything happened to\n",
      "Jack.\"\n",
      "\"It would be a pity; it suits you.\" She was not referring to the hall,\n",
      "which was somewhat too light and small for the heroic mould of its\n",
      "chatelaine, but to the noble proportions of the old house itself, and\n",
      "the treasures that had accumulated since the first foundations were laid\n",
      "in the reign of Henry VI. There were rooms hung with ugly brocades and\n",
      "velvets never duplicated, state bed-chambers and boudoirs sacred to the\n",
      "memory of personages whose dust lay half-forgotten in their marbles; but\n",
      "above all, Capheaton was famous for its pictures. Not only was there an\n",
      "unusually large number of portraits by masters scattered about the\n",
      "twenty rooms that lay behind and on either side of the hall, but many\n",
      "hundreds of those portraits and landscapes from the brushes of artists\n",
      "fashionable in their day, unknown in the annals of art, but seeming to\n",
      "emit a faint scent of lavender and rose leaves from the walls of\n",
      "England's old manor-houses and castles. In the dining-room there was a\n",
      "full-length portrait of Mary Tudor, black but for the yellow face and\n",
      "hands and ruff; and another, the scarlet coat and robust complexion\n",
      "still fresh, of the fourth George, handsome, gay, devil-may-care; both\n",
      "painted to commemorate visits to Capheaton, historically hospitable in\n",
      "the past. But Lord Strathland, besides having been presented with six\n",
      "daughters and an heir as extravagant as tradition demanded, was poor as\n",
      "peers go, and had more than once succumbed to the titillating delights\n",
      "of speculation, less cheering in the retrospect. Having a still larger\n",
      "estate to keep up, he had been glad to lend Capheaton to his second son,\n",
      "who, being an excellent manager and assisted by his wife's income, had\n",
      "lived very comfortably upon its yield. Upon his death Elton Gwynne had\n",
      "assumed possession as a matter of course; and a handsome allowance from\n",
      "his doting grandfather supplementing his inheritance, the mind of the\n",
      "haughty and promising young gentleman was free of sordid anxieties.\n",
      "Lady Victoria's satirical gaze swept the simpering portraits of her\n",
      "son's great-aunts and grandmothers, with which the hall was\n",
      "promiscuously hung.\n",
      "\"Of course I am as English as if the strain had never been crossed, if\n",
      "you mean that. But I'd rather like to get away for a while. I really\n",
      "ought to visit my California estates, and I have always wanted to see\n",
      "that part of America. I started for it once, but never even reached the\n",
      "western boundaries of New York. One of us should spend a year there, at\n",
      "least; and of course it is out of the question for Jack to leave England\n",
      "again.\"\n",
      "\"You would not spend six months out of Curzon Street. You are the most\n",
      "confirmed Londoner I know.\"\n",
      "\"Do you think so?\"\n",
      "Miss Thangue replied, impulsively, \"I have often wondered if you\n",
      "numbered satiety among your complexities!\"\n",
      "This was as far as she had ever adventured into the mysterious\n",
      "backwaters of Victoria's soul, and she dropped her eyelids lest a\n",
      "deprecating glance meet the contempt it deserved; both with a due regard\n",
      "for the limit imposed by good taste, despised the faint heart.\n",
      "\"I hate the sight of London!\" Her tone had changed so suddenly that\n",
      "Flora winked. \"If it were not for Jack I would leave--get out. I am sick\n",
      "of the whole game.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, be on your guard,\" cried her friend, sharply. \"That sort of thing\n",
      "means the end of youth.\"\n",
      "\"Youth after fifty depends upon your doctor, your masseuse, and your\n",
      "dressmaker. I do not say that my present state of mind is sown with\n",
      "evergreens and immortelles, but the fact remains that for the present I\n",
      "have come to the end of myself and am interested in no one on earth but\n",
      "Jack.\"\n",
      "Miss Thangue stared into her teacup, recalling the gossip of a year ago,\n",
      "although she had given it little heed at the time: Victoria had been\n",
      "transiently interested so often! But all the world knew that when Arthur\n",
      "Gwynne was killed Sir Cadge Vanneck had been off his head about\n",
      "Victoria; and that when obvious restrictions vanished into the family\n",
      "vault he had left abruptly for Rhodesia to develop his mines, and had\n",
      "not found time to return since. Sir Cadge was about the same age as the\n",
      "famous beauty, and rose quite two inches above her lofty head. People\n",
      "had grown accustomed to the fine appearance they made when\n",
      "together--\"Artie\" was ruddy and stout--and although Victoria reinforced\n",
      "her enemies, for Vanneck was one of the most agreeable and accomplished\n",
      "men in London, the artistic sense of that lenient world was tickled at\n",
      "their congruities and took their future mating for granted; Arthur\n",
      "Gwynne was sure to meet his death on the hunting-field, for he was far\n",
      "too heavy for a horse and rode vilely. When he fulfilled his destiny and\n",
      "Vanneck fled, the world was as much annoyed as amused. But they were\n",
      "amused, and Flora Thangue knew that this gall must have bitten deeper\n",
      "than the loss of Vanneck, who may or may not have made an impression on\n",
      "this woman too proud and too spoiled to accept homage in public\n",
      "otherwise than passively, whatever may have been the unwritten tale of\n",
      "her secret hours. The excuses hazarded by Vanneck's friends were neither\n",
      "humorous nor sentimental, but no one denied that they were eminently\n",
      "sensible: his first wife had died childless, his estates were large, his\n",
      "title was one of the oldest in England. But although no one pitied\n",
      "Victoria Gwynne, many were annoyed at having their mental attitude\n",
      "disarranged, and this no doubt had kept the gossip alive and been a\n",
      "constant source of irritation to a woman whose sense of humor was as\n",
      "deep as her pride.\n",
      "Flora replied at random. \"Jack couldn't very well get on without you.\"\n",
      "His mother's eyes flashed. \"I flatter myself he could not--at present.\n",
      "If Julia Kaye would only marry him!\"\n",
      "\"She won't,\" cried Flora, relieved at the change of tone. \"And\n",
      "why do you wish it? She is two years older, of quite dreadful\n",
      "origin--and--well--I don't like her; perhaps my opinion is a little\n",
      "biased.\"\n",
      "\"She is immensely rich, one of the ablest political women in London, and\n",
      "Jack is desperately in love with her.\"\n",
      "\"I cannot picture Jack in extremities about any one, although I don't\n",
      "deny that he has his sentimental seizures. He even made love to me when\n",
      "he was cutting his teeth. But he doesn't need a lot of money, you rank\n",
      "higher than she among the political women, and--well, I believe her to\n",
      "be bad-tempered, and more selfish than any woman I have ever known.\"\n",
      "\"He loves her. He wants her. He would dominate any woman he married. He\n",
      "is such a dear that no woman who lived with him could help loving him.\n",
      "Moreover, she is inordinately ambitious, and Jack's career is the most\n",
      "promising in England.\"\n",
      "\"Jack is far too good for her, and I am glad that he will not get her. I\n",
      "happen to know that she has made up her mind to marry Lord Brathland.\"\n",
      "\"Bratty is a donkey.\"\n",
      "\"She would be the last to deny it, but he is certain to be a duke if he\n",
      "lives, and she would marry a man that had to be led round with a string\n",
      "for the sake of being called 'your grace' by the servants. She'll never\n",
      "be anything but a third-rate duchess, and people that tolerate her now\n",
      "will snub her the moment she gives herself airs. But I suppose she\n",
      "thinks a duchess is a duchess.\"\n",
      "\"Money goes pretty far with us,\" said Lady Victoria, dryly.\n",
      "\"Doesn't it? Nevertheless--you know it as well as I do--among the people\n",
      "that really count other things go further, and duchesses have been put\n",
      "in their place before this--you have done it yourself. Julia Kaye has\n",
      "kept her head so far because she has been hunting for strawberry leaves,\n",
      "and there is no denying she's clever; but once she is in the upper\n",
      "air--well, I have seen her as rude as she dares be, and if she became a\n",
      "duchess she would cultivate rudeness as part of the role.\"\n",
      "\"We can be rude enough.\"\n",
      "\"Yes, and know how to be. A parvenu never does.\"\n",
      "\"She is astonishingly clever.\"\n",
      "\"Duchesses are born--even the American ones. Julia Kaye has never\n",
      "succeeded in being quite natural; she has always the effect of\n",
      "rehearsing the part of the great lady for amateur theatricals. Poor\n",
      "Gussy Kaye might have coached her better. The moment she mounts she'll\n",
      "become wholly artificial, she'll patronize, she'll give herself no end\n",
      "of ridiculous airs; she won't move without sending a paragraph to the\n",
      "_Morning Post_. The back of her head will be quite in line with her\n",
      "charming little bust, and I for one shall walk round and laugh in her\n",
      "face. She is the only person that could inspire me to such a vicious\n",
      "speech, but I am human, and as she so ingenuously snubs me as a person\n",
      "of no consequence, my undazzled eyes see her as she is.\"\n",
      "Lady Victoria, instead of responding with the faint, absent, somewhat\n",
      "irritating smile which she commonly vouchsafed those that sought to\n",
      "amuse her, lit another cigarette and leaned back among the cushions of\n",
      "the sofa behind the tea-table. She drew her eyelids together, a rare\n",
      "sign of perturbation. The only stigma of time on her face was a certain\n",
      "sharpness of outline and leanness of throat. But the throat was always\n",
      "covered, and her wardrobe reflected the most fleeting of the fashions,\n",
      "assuring her position as a contemporary, if driving her dressmaker to\n",
      "the verge of bankruptcy. When her bright, black, often laughing eyes\n",
      "were in play she passed with the casual public, and abroad, as a woman\n",
      "of thirty, but with her lids down the sharpness of the lower part of the\n",
      "face arrested the lover of detail.\n",
      "\"Are you sure of that?\" she asked, in a moment.\n",
      "\"Quite.\"\n",
      "\"I am sorry. It will be a great blow to Jack. I hoped she would come\n",
      "round in time.\"\n",
      "\"She will marry Brathland. I saw Cecilia Spence in town. She was at\n",
      "Maundrell Abbey with them both last week. You may expect the\n",
      "announcement any day--she'll write it herself for the _Morning Post_.\n",
      "How on earth can Jack find time to think about women with the immense\n",
      "amount of work he gets through?--and his really immodest ambitions!\n",
      "By-the-way--isn't this polling-day? I wonder if he has won his seat? But\n",
      "as I said just now I do not associate Jack with defeat. His trifling\n",
      "set-backs have merely served to throw his manifest destiny into higher\n",
      "relief.\"\n",
      "\"The telegram should have come an hour ago. I have few doubts--and yet\n",
      "he has so many enemies. I wonder if we shall be born into a world, after\n",
      "we have been sufficiently chastened here, where one can get one's head\n",
      "above the multitude without rousing some of the most hideous qualities\n",
      "in human nature? It is a great responsibility! But there has been no\n",

      "\"As if that mattered. Besides, he is a born fighter. He'd hate anything\n",
      "he could have for the asking. And he's far too modern, too progressive,\n",
      "for the Conservative party--even if there were anything but blue-mould\n",
      "left in it.\"\n",
      "\"Well, you know I am not original, and my poor old dad brought us up on\n",
      "the soundest Tory principles; he never would even compromise on the word\n",
      "Conservative. But considering that Jack is as Liberal as if the taint\n",
      "were in the marrow of his bones, what a blessing that poor Artie did not\n",
      "happen to be the oldest son. Cecilia says they were all talking of it at\n",
      "Maundrell Abbey, where of course it is a peculiarly interesting topic.\n",
      "That ornamental and conscientious peer, Lord Barnstable, has never\n",
      "ceased to regret his father's death, for reasons far removed from\n",
      "sentimental. He told Cecilia that Lord Strathland almost confessed to\n",
      "him that he would give his right eye to hand over his old shoes to Jack,\n",
      "not only because he detests Zeal, but because it would take the backbone\n",
      "out of his Liberalism--\"\n",
      "\"And ruin _his_ career. Thank heaven Zeal is engaged at last. They will\n",
      "marry in the spring, and then the only cloud on Jack's horizon will\n",

      "\"What if there were no children?\"\n",

      "She opened a door in a corner of the hall where the newly arrived guests\n",
      "were gathered about Lady Victoria's tea-table, and led the way up a wide\n",
      "dark and slippery stair. After the first landing the light was stronger,\n",
      "and the walls were, to an inch, covered with portraits and landscapes,\n",
      "the effect almost as careless as if the big open space were a\n",
      "lumber-room.\n",
      "\"Are they _all_ old masters?\" asked Miss Isabel Otis, politely, her eyes\n",
      "roving over the dark canvases.\n",
      "\"Oh no; the masters are down-stairs. I'll show them to you to-morrow.\n",
      "These are not bad, though.\"\n",
      "\"What a lot of ancestors to have!\"\n",
      "\"Oh, you'll find them all over the house. These are not Gwynnes. This\n",
      "house came to Lord Strathland through the female line. It will be Jack's\n",
      "eventually--one way or another; and Jack must be more like the Eltons\n",
      "than the Gwynnes--unless, indeed, he is like his American ancestors.\"\n",
      "She turned her soft non-committal eyes on the stranger. \"You are his\n",
      "thirty-first cousin, are you not?\"\n",
      "\"Not quite so remote. But why do you call him Jack? He is known to fame\n",
      "as Elton Gwynne.\"\n",
      "\"His name is John Elton Cecil Gwynne. We are given to the nickname these\n",
      "days--to the abbreviation in general.\"\n",

      "where--ah, here it is.\"\n",
      "She opened the door of a square room with large roses on the white\n",
      "wall-paper, and fine old mahogany furniture. The sofa and chairs and\n",
      "windows were covered with a chintz in harmony with the walls. \"It is\n",
      "cheerful, don't you think so?\" asked Miss Thangue, drawing one of the\n",
      "straight curtains aside. \"Vicky had all the rooms done over, and I chose\n",
      "the designs. She is quite intolerantly modern, and holds that when\n",
      "wall-paper and chintz can save an old house from looking like a\n",
      "sarcophagus, why not have them? That bell-cord connects with your maid's\n",
      "room--\"\n",
      "\"I have no maid. I am not well off at all. I wonder Lady Victoria\n",
      "thought it worth while to ask me down.\"\n",
      "\"Dear me, how odd! May I sit with you a little while? I never before saw\n",
      "a poor American girl.\"\n",
      "\"I'll be only too grateful if you will stay with me as long as you can.\n",
      "I am not exactly poor. I have a ranch near Rosewater, some property and\n",
      "an old house in San Francisco. All that makes me comfortable, but no\n",
      "more; and there are so many terribly rich American girls!\"\n",
      "\"There are, indeed!\" Miss Thangue sat forward with the frank curiosity\n",
      "of the Englishwoman when inspecting a foreign specimen. But her\n",
      "curiosity was kindly, for she was still a girl at heart, interested in\n",
      "other girls. Miss Otis, looking at her blond, virginal face, took for\n",
      "granted that she was under thirty, and owed her weight to a fondness for\n",
      "sweets and sauces.\n",
      "\"How can you travel in Europe if you are not rich?\" demanded Flora. \"I\n",
      "never dare venture over except as the guest of some more fortunate\n",
      "friend.\"\n",
      "\"Are _you_ poor?\" asked Miss Otis, her eye arrested by the smart little\n",
      "afternoon frock of lace and chiffon and crepe-de-chine.\n",
      "\"Oh, horribly. But then we all are, over here. If it were not for the\n",
      "Jews and the Americans we'd have to make our own clothes. The\n",
      "dressmakers never could afford to give us credit.\"\n",
      "\"They all looked very wealthy down-stairs.\"\n",
      "\"Smart, rather. This happens to be a set that knows how to dress. Many\n",
      "don't. You know something of it yourself,\" she added, with a frank\n",
      "survey of the girl's well-cut travelling-frock and small hat. \"Lots of\n",
      "Americans don't, if you don't mind my saying so--for all their\n",
      "reputation. I went to a dinner at an American Legation once and two of\n",
      "your countrywomen came with their hats on. They had brought letters to\n",
      "the Minister, and he hadn't taken the precaution of looking them over.\n",
      "He was terribly mortified, poor thing.\"\n",
      "She related the anecdote with philanthropic intention, but Miss Otis put\n",
      "her half-rejected doubts to flight by remarking, lightly:\n",
      "\"We don't do that even in Rosewater.\"\n",
      "\"Where _is_ Rosewater? What a jolly name!\"\n",
      "\"It is in northern California, not far from Lady Victoria's ranch and\n",
      "what is left of ours. I have spent most of my life in or near it--my\n",
      "father was a lawyer.\"\n",
      "\"Do tell me about yourself!\" Like most amiable spinsters, she was as\n",
      "interested in the suggestive stranger as in a new novel. She sank with a\n",
      "sigh of comfort into the depths of the chair. \"May I smoke? Are you\n",
      "shocked?\"\n",
      "Then she colored apprehensively, fearing that her doubt might be\n",
      "construed as an insult to Rosewater.\n",
      "But Miss Otis met it with her first smile. \"Oh no,\" she replied. \"Will\n",
      "you give me one? Mine are in my trunk and they haven't brought it up.\"\n",

      "moments in silence.\n",
      "\"I don't know why you should be interested in my history,\" she said at\n",

      "animation. \"It has been far too uneventful. I have an adopted sister,\n",
      "six years older than myself, who married twelve years ago. Her husband\n",

      "My mother died when I was little. After my sister married I took care of\n",
      "my father until I was twenty-one, when he died--four years ago. There\n",

      "regarded her with a swelling interest. It was a type of which she had no\n",
      "knowledge, evidently not a common type even in the hypothetical land of\n",
      "the free; she had visited New York and Newport and known many Americans.\n",
      "True, she had never met the provincial type before, but she doubted if\n",

      "alternately speaking out and knowing nothing? Was she merely an\n",
      "egoist--it ran in the family--or did it conceal much that she had no\n",
      "intention of revealing? Her very beauty was of a type rarely seen in the\n",
      "America of to-day, prevalent as it may have been a hundred years ago:\n",
      "she looked like a feminine edition of the first group of American\n",
      "statesmen--although black Spanish hair was pulled carelessly over the\n",
      "high forehead, a heavy coil encircling the head in a long upward sweep,\n",
      "and the half-dreaming, half-penetrating regard of the light-blue eyes\n",
      "was softened by a heavy growth of lash. The eyebrows were low and thick,\n",
      "the upper lip was sensitive, quivering sometimes as she talked, but the\n",
      "lower was firm and full. It was the brow, the profile, the strength of\n",
      "character expressed, the general seriousness of the fine face and head,\n",
      "that made her look like a reversion to the type that gave birth to a\n",
      "nation. But Miss Thangue had seen too much of the world to judge any one\n",
      "by his inherited shell. She had observed many Americans with fine heads\n",
      "and bulging brows concealing practically nothing, insignificant German\n",
      "heads whose intellects had terrified her, the romantic Spanish eyes of\n",
      "the most unromantic people in Europe, English pride and an icy mask of\n",
      "breeding guarding from the casual eye the most lawless and ribald\n",
      "instincts. Therefore had she no intention of taking this new specimen on\n",
      "trust, much as she liked her, and she speculated upon her possibilities\n",
      "in the friendly silence that had fallen between them. Life is composed\n",
      "of individuals and their choruses, and Flora, humorously admitting the\n",
      "fact, was far more interested in others than in herself.\n",
      "Only in the dense silky masses of her black hair and the almost stolid\n",
      "absence of gesture did the American betray her Spanish ancestry; but how\n",
      "much of the Spaniard, subtle, patient, vengeful, treacherous, mighty in\n",
      "passive resistance and cunning, lay behind those deep fearless blue eyes\n",
      "of her New England ancestors? Or was she not Spanish at all, but merely\n",
      "a higher type of American--or wholly herself? Would Jack, susceptible\n",
      "and passionate, a worshipper of beauty down among the roots of his\n",
      "abnormal cleverness and egoism, fall in love with her? And what then?\n",
      "The girl, with her strong stern profile against the shadows, her low\n",
      "brooding brows, might wield a power far more dangerous than that of the\n",
      "average fascinating woman, if her will marshalled the rest of her\n",
      "faculties and drove them in a straight line; although the luminous skin\n",
      "as polished as ivory, the low full curves and slow graceful movements of\n",
      "her figure added a potency that Flora, always an amused observer of men,\n",
      "would have been the last to ignore. Victoria, high-bred, fastidious,\n",
      "mocking, yet unmistakably passionate and possibly insurgent, was of\n",
      "that mint of woman about whom men had gone mad since the world began.\n",
      "But this girl, who might be as cold as the moon, or not, looked, in any\n",
      "case, capable of clasping a man's throat with her strong little hand,\n",
      "and gently turning his head from east to west. At this point Miss\n",
      "Thangue rose impatiently and rang a bell. Jack's career was almost at\n",
      "the flood. No woman could submerge his intellect and stupendous\n",
      "interests for more than a moment.\n",
      "\"Order lights and have your trunks brought up,\" she said. \"I will send\n",
      "one of the housemaids to help you dress. My room is over on the other\n",
      "side of the house--go through that door opposite, and down a corridor\n",
      "until you come to another long hall and staircase like the one on this\n",
      "side. You will find my name on the door. Knock at about a quarter-past\n",
      "eight and I will go down with you. Vicky may be in an angelic humor and\n",
      "she may not. It depends mainly upon whether Jack condescends to turn up.\n",
      "I suppose you know all about him; it would hardly do for you to face him\n",
      "and his mother if you didn't. He has travelled quite exhaustively in the\n",
      "colonies and given us some of the most informing literature on that\n",
      "subject that we have. He was out in Africa when the Boer War broke out,\n",
      "and once before in India, when there was fighting, volunteered both\n",
      "times and did brilliant service. He has no end of medals with clasps.\n",

      "himself; and it has alienated many of his relatives on both sides--which\n",
      "gave him one more chance to win against terrific odds; he enjoys that\n",
      "sort of thing. He had been in but two years when there was a general\n",

      "before he won his seat this time, and he had almost as hard a fight\n",

      "most distinguished of the political women, but still turns heads when\n",
      "she chooses, and her game is generally in the cabinet preserves, when it\n",
      "is not in the diplomatic. I must run. Put on your most fetching gown.\n",
      "Julia Kaye, a detestable little parvenu, is here. Jack is in love with\n",
      "her and she has chosen another. It will be a cousinly duty to console\n",
      "him. Then you can turn him over to some one else. Ta, ta!\" Her last\n",
      "words floated back from the depths of the corridor; a clock was striking\n",

      "The \"Jack,\" whose more distinguished patronymic was so gayly caracolling\n",
      "down the road to posterity, had arrived, and after dressing hastily,\n",
      "sought his mother. Her hair was done, her gown laced; she dismissed her\n",
      "maid at once, and while her eyes melted, in the fashion of mothers, she\n",
      "embraced her son with something more than maternal warmth: a curious\n",
      "suggestion of relief, of stepping out of her own personality and leaving\n",
      "it like a heap of clothes on the floor. This attitude had occasionally\n",
      "puzzled her idol, but he was too masculine to analyze. She was his best\n",
      "friend and a delightful person to have for a mother; her soul might be\n",
      "her own possession undisturbed. He admired her almost as much as he did\n",
      "himself, and to-night he kissed her fondly and told her gallantly that\n",
      "she was looking even more beautiful than usual.\n",
      "\"It is all this white after the dead black,\" said Lady Victoria, smiling\n",
      "appreciatively. \"I am thankful that prolonged mourning is out of date;\n",
      "it made a fright of me and was getting on my nerves.\" She wore no jewels\n",
      "save a high diamond dog-collar and a few sparkling combs in her hair,\n",
      "but she made a superb appearance with the long white sweep of shoulders\n",
      "and bust, her brilliant eyes and smart tailed gown of black chiffon and\n",
      "Irish lace. Her arms, no longer rounded as when artists had fought to\n",
      "paint her, were but half-revealed under floating sleeves, and her fair\n",
      "tapering hands were even younger than her face.\n",
      "She opened a large black fan and moved it slowly while looking intently\n",
      "at her son's bent profile. \"Something has gone wrong,\" she said. \"Have\n",
      "you seen Julia Kaye again?\"\n",
      "\"No, I was invited to Maundrell Abbey last week, but couldn't manage it,\n",
      "of course. And I knew she was to be here. Nothing has gone wrong--but I\n",
      "had rather a shock this morning. I met Zeal at the club. He looks like a\n",
      "death's head. He vowed he was taking even better care of himself than\n",
      "usual, but his chest is bad again. He talked about going to Davos--the\n",
      "very word makes me sick! In the next breath he said he might go out to\n",
      "Africa. Can't you hurry on his marriage?--persuade Carry that it is her\n",
      "duty to go with him?\"\n",
      "\"I should have no difficulty persuading Carry. The rub is with him.\n",
      "Compulsory asceticism has bred misogyny, and misogyny scruples. He says\n",
      "that he has sins enough to his account without laying up a reckoning\n",
      "with posterity. If it were not for you I should agree with him. I feel\n",
      "like a conspirator--\"\n",
      "\"There is no reason why his children should be consumptive. Carry's\n",
      "physique is Wagnerian, and she is just the woman to look after her\n",
      "children herself. Zeal's health was thrown to the dogs by a weak\n",
      "indulgent frivolous mother, and what she left him he disposed of later\n",
      "when he made as great an ass of himself as might have been expected. He\n",
      "is a hypochondriac now and would keep a close watch on his heir's health\n",
      "and habits; you may be sure of that. He ought not to be in London\n",
      "now--it is stifling--went up for some business meeting or other--seemed\n",
      "to wish to avoid details. I hope to heaven he has not been relieving the\n",
      "monotony of his life by some rotten speculation. I begged him to come\n",
      "down here, but he wouldn't--says that his hand is no longer steady\n",
      "enough to hold a gun--it's awful!--worse because I'm not merely fond of\n",
      "him and regretting the possible loss of a good friend--I have felt like\n",
      "a beast all day. But I can't help it. For God's sake write and persuade\n",
      "him to go to Davos at once--and picture the delights of a pretty and\n",
      "devoted nurse. I feel as if I had ashes in my mouth--and yesterday I was\n",
      "so happy!\" he burst out, with the petulance of a child.\n",
      "\"I will write to-night,\" she said, soothingly. \"He has a very slow form\n",
      "of consumption; I have the assurance of his doctors. And at least he has\n",
      "committed himself with Carry, and announced his intention to marry as\n",
      "soon as a sojourn somewhere has made him feel fit again. You know how\n",
      "much better he always is when he comes back. Put it out of your mind\n",
      "to-night. I want you to be as happy as I am. Everybody is talking of the\n",
      "brilliance of your campaign--\"\n",
      "\"Much good brilliance will do me if I am to rot in the Upper House!\"\n",
      "\"Put it out of your mind; don't let apprehension control you for a\n",
      "moment. Believe me, will-power counts in life for more than everything\n",
      "else combined, and if it isn't watched it weakens.\"\n",
      "\"All right, mummy. You are never so original as when you preach. So\n",
      "Julia Kaye came down this afternoon? Talk about will. Mine should be of\n",
      "pure steel; I have ordered her out of my consciousness these last weeks\n",
      "at the point of the bayonet. She has written me exactly three times.\n",
      "However--those letters were charming,\" he added, with the sudden smile\n",
      "that transfigured his face, routing the overbearing and contemptuous\n",
      "expression that had won him so many enemies; friends and flatterers and\n",
      "the happy circumstances of his life had combined thoroughly to spoil\n",
      "him. \"Do you maintain that will can win a woman?\" he added, sharply.\n",
      "She was the woman to laugh outright at such a suggestion. \"No, nor that\n",
      "it can uproot love, although it can give it a good shaking and lock it\n",
      "in the dark room. I doubt if you love Julia Kaye, but you will find that\n",
      "out for yourself. You might bring her to terms by flirting a little with\n",
      "your American cousin--\"\n",
      "\"My what?\" He opened his eyes as widely as he had ever done when a\n",
      "school-boy.\n",
      "\"Of course--I forgot you know nothing of her. She wrote me from\n",
      "Ambleside--I infer she has been 'doing' England; and as her credentials\n",
      "were unimpeachable I asked her down. She has inherited a part of the\n",
      "northern estate and was brought up in the neighboring town of\n",
      "Rosewater--the American names are too silly. She seems quite _comme il\n",
      "faut_ and is remarkably handsome. I detest Americans, as you know, but\n",
      "there certainly is something in blood. I liked her at once. She looks\n",
      "clever, and is quite off the type--none of the usual fluff. If she\n",
      "doesn't bore me I shall keep her here for a while.\"\n",
      "\"I wish you would adopt her,\" he said, fondly. \"I shouldn't be jealous,\n",
      "for I hate to think of you so much alone.\" He rose and kissed her\n",
      "lightly on the forehead, experience teaching him to avoid a stray hair\n",
      "from the carefully built coiffure. \"I'll see if I can waylay Julia on\n",
      "the stairs; she is always late. Keep from eleven to twelve for me\n",
      "to-morrow morning. I want to tell you about the campaign. It was a\n",
      "glorious fight!\" His eyes sparkled at the memory of it. \"I felt as if\n",
      "every bit of me had never been alive at once before. My opponent was a\n",
      "splendid chap. It meant something to beat him. The other side was in a\n",
      "rage!--more than once yelled for half an hour after I took the platform.\n",
      "When I finished they yelled again for half an hour--to a different\n",
      "tune.\" His slight, thin, rather graceless figure seemed suddenly to\n",
      "expand, even to grow taller. Some hidden magnetism burst from him like\n",
      "an aura, and his cold pasty face and light gray eyes flamed into\n",
      "positive beauty. \"It was glorious! Glorious! I was intoxicated--I could\n",
      "have reeled, little as they suspected it. I wouldn't part for a second\n",
      "with the certainty that I am the biggest figure in young England to-day.\n",
      "I hate to sleep and forget it. If I cultivated modesty I should renounce\n",
      "one of the exquisite pleasures of life. Humility is a superstition. The\n",
      "man who doesn't weed it out is an ass. To be young, well-born, with\n",
      "money enough, a brain instead of a mere intelligence, an essential\n",
      "leader of men--Good God! Good God!\" Then he subsided and blushed, jerked\n",
      "up his shoulders and laughed. \"Well--I never let myself go to any one\n",
      "but you,\" he said. \"And I won't inflict _you_ any longer.\"\n",
      "IV\n",
      "\"I wish the old homes of England had electric lights,\" thought Miss\n",
      "Otis, with a sigh.\n",
      "There were four candles on the dressing-table, two on the mantel-shelf;\n",
      "beyond the radius of their light the room was barely visible. She\n",
      "carried one of the candles over to the cheval-glass and held it above\n",
      "her head, close to her face, low on either side.\n",
      "\"I feel as if I had been put together by some unpleasant mechanical\n",
      "process. It is well I am not inordinately vain, but when one puts on a\n",
      "new dress for the first time--\" She shrugged her shoulders hopelessly,\n",
      "replaced the candle, and walked up and down the room swinging the\n",
      "train--her first--of the charming gown of pale blue satin; patting the\n",
      "hair coiled softly about the entire head in a line eminently becoming to\n",
      "the profile, and prolonged by several little curls escaping to the neck.\n",
      "She felt happy and excited, her fine almost severe face far more\n",
      "girlishly alive than when she had told her story, provocatively dry, to\n",
      "Flora Thangue. She directed an approving glance at the high heels of her\n",
      "slippers, which, with her lofty carriage, produced the effect of\n",
      "non-existing inches. She was barely five feet five, but she ranked with\n",
      "tall women, her height as unchallenged as the chiselling of her profile.\n",
      "\"What frauds we all are!\" she thought, with a humor of which she had\n",
      "not vouchsafed Miss Thangue a hint. \"But what is a cunningly made\n",
      "slipper on a foot not so small, at the end of a body not quite long\n",
      "enough, but an encouraging example of the triumph of art over nature?\n",
      "Not the superiority, perhaps, but they are the best of working\n",
      "partners.\"\n",
      "She sat down and recalled the conversation with her new friend, giving\n",
      "an amused little shudder. She had heard much of, and in her travels come\n",
      "into contact with, the cold-blooded frankness of the English elect; with\n",
      "whom it was either an instinct or a pose to manifest their careless\n",
      "sense of impregnability. When pressed to give an account of herself the\n",
      "dramatic possibilities of the method suddenly appealed to her,\n",
      "accompanied by a mischievous desire to outdo them at their own game and\n",
      "observe the effect. She had found herself as absorbed as an actress in a\n",
      "new and congenial role.\n",
      "\"After all,\" she thought, \"clever women make themselves over in great\n",
      "part, uprooting here, adopting there, and as we have so little chance to\n",
      "_be_ anything, there is a good deal to be got out of it. If one cannot\n",
      "be a genius one can at least be an artist. I have never had much cause\n",
      "to be as direct as stage lightning, but as I enjoyed it I suppose I may\n",
      "infer that even brutal frankness is not foreign to my nature. Perhaps,\n",
      "like father, I am a snob at heart and liked the sensation of a sort of\n",
      "artistic alliance with the British aristocracy. Well, if I develop\n",
      "snobbery I can root out that weed--or persuade myself that some other\n",
      "motive is at the base of a disposition to adopt any of the\n",
      "characteristics of this people: a woman can persuade herself of any\n",
      "sophistry she chooses. Not for anything would I be a man. Absolutely to\n",
      "accept the facts of life, even the ugly unvarnished fact itself, and at\n",
      "the same time to invent one's own soul-tunes--that is to be a woman and\n",
      "free!\"\n",
      "A printed square of card-board on her writing-table had informed her\n",
      "that the dinner-hour was half-past eight. She looked at her watch. It\n",
      "was five minutes to the time. Once more she peered into the glass, shook\n",
      "out her skirts, then sought a door in a far and dusky corner. It opened\n",
      "upon a long dimly lit corridor which led into another at right angles,\n",
      "and Isabel presently found herself at the head of a staircase similar to\n",
      "the one on her side of the house. Here, too, the walls were hung with\n",
      "portraits and landscapes, and as far down as the eye could follow; but\n",
      "after glancing over them for a moment with the recurring weariness of\n",
      "one who has seen too many pictures in the hard ways of European travel,\n",
      "her eyes lit and lingered on the figure of a young man who stood on the\n",
      "landing, his back to her, examining, with a certain tensity, a canvas on\n",
      "a level with his eyes.\n",
      "\"Uncle Hiram--John Elton Cecil Gwynne! What a likeness and what a\n",
      "difference!\"\n",
      "The young Englishman's hair, pale in color and very smooth, was worn\n",
      "longer than the fashion, the ends lilting. As he turned slowly at the\n",
      "rustle of descending skirts, this eccentricity and his colorless skin\n",
      "made him look the pale student rather than the gallant soldier, the best\n",
      "fighter on the hustings that England had seen for five-and-twenty years.\n",
      "As Isabel walked carefully down the slippery stair she veiled her eyes\n",
      "to hide the wonder in them. She had expected personality, magnetism, as\n",
      "a compensation for nature's external economies. His apparent lack of\n",
      "both made him almost repellent, awakened in Isabel a sensation of\n",
      "antagonism; and the cool speculation in his light gray eyes merely\n",
      "accentuated his general dearth of charm. True he had height--although\n",
      "his carriage was unimposing--his head was large and well-proportioned,\n",
      "his nose and chin salient, but the straight heavy mouth was as\n",
      "contemptuous as a Prussian officer's, and in spite of his grooming he\n",
      "looked old-fashioned, absurdly like the Uncle Hiram who had been a\n",
      "country lawyer and farmer, and had always worn broadcloth in the hottest\n",
      "weather--except, to be sure, when he wore a linen \"duster,\" or sat on\n",
      "the veranda in his shirt-sleeves, his feet on the railing.\n",
      "However, she smiled, and he smiled politely in return, advancing a few\n",
      "steps to meet her. \"I hope you have heard of me,\" she said. \"Your mother\n",
      "is so busy--English people are so indifferent to details--I am your\n",
      "cousin, Isabel Otis--\"\n",
      "\"Of course my mother has spoken of you. I am very glad to see you in my\n",
      "house,\" he added, hospitably. \"Shall I show you the way?\"\n",
      "He made no further remark as they descended the darker section of the\n",
      "stair, and she could think of nothing to say to him. Nor did she\n",
      "particularly care to think of anything, the American in her resenting\n",
      "his lack of effort. But as they reached the door she paused abruptly.\n",
      "\"I forgot! Miss Thangue asked me to knock at her door--\"\n",
      "\"You take us too seriously,\" he said, with a slight sneer. \"Flora has\n",
      "evidently forgotten you; she came down a quarter of an hour ago.\"\n",
      "Isabel lifted her head still higher, annoyed at the angry blood that\n",
      "leaped to her face. \"I am afraid I am rather literal,\" she said, with\n",
      "more hauteur than the occasion demanded. \"But perhaps you will tell me\n",
      "where to go. There seems to be a bewildering number of rooms. After\n",
      "three years of lodgings in Europe, to say nothing of the modest\n",
      "architecture of Rosewater, I feel as if astray in a maze.\"\n",
      "\"You got that off as if you were a masquerading princess,\" he said, with\n",
      "a flicker of humor in his eyes. \"Americans generally bluff the other\n",
      "way.\" He opened the door. \"We meet here in the hall. There is my mother.\n",
      "You are not obliged to speak to her, you know. We are less formal in\n",
      "life than in novels.\" With this parting shot he left her abruptly and\n",
      "joined a small dark woman with a plebeian face, a sensual mouth, and\n",
      "magnificent black eyes.\n",
      "\"The rude beast!--Julia Kaye, of course.\" But Isabel forgot them both in\n",
      "the novelty of the scene. The square white hall was lit with wax-candles\n",
      "and shaded lamps, and filled with the murmur of voices--beautiful\n",
      "gowns--the sparkle of jewels. Isabel dismissed the memory of early\n",
      "trials, the long years she had lived in the last three, her philosophic\n",
      "resignation to the disillusions and disappointments with which her\n",
      "liberty had been pitted; it was her first appearance in the world of\n",
      "fashion--which she entered, after all, by a sort of divine right.\n",
      "Trepidation was undeveloped in her, and when she had stood for a moment,\n",
      "quite aware that her proud and singular beauty had won her instant\n",
      "recognition, she walked over to her hostess.\n",
      "No fresh demand was made on her courage. Lady Victoria's earlier mood of\n",
      "colossal indifference had been dissipated by her son's return. She\n",
      "greeted Isabel with a dazzling smile and a winning gesture.\n",
      "\"Isn't Jack a darling? Isn't he a dear?\" she commanded. \"I have put you\n",
      "on his left, that you may be sure not to be bored. What hair! That is\n",
      "_your_ legacy from Spain. I have the eyes, but I never had a foot of\n",
      "hair. I hope you are comfortable. I expect you to remain a week. I am so\n",
      "glad that Jack will be here. The place is intolerably dull without him.\"\n",
      "Isabel, warming to such maternal ardor in a beauty whose years were\n",
      "prematurely emphasized by a son as conspicuous as Elton Gwynne, summoned\n",
      "a few vague words of enthusiasm. She was reproached politely for\n",
      "wandering about England for two months before discovering herself to her\n",
      "relatives; then, Lady Victoria's interest waning, she turned to a young\n",
      "man, handsome and Saxon and orthodox, and said, casually, \"Jimmy, you\n",
      "will take in Miss Otis.\"\n",
      "Dinner had already been announced. The twain, in complete ignorance of\n",
      "each other's identity, walked through a long line of rooms, almost\n",
      "unfurnished but for the scowling or smiling dead crowding the walls.\n",
      "Isabel decided that she would be as effortless as the English and see\n",
      "what came of it. The practised instinct of the American girl, added to\n",
      "the excessive hospitality of the Californian, would have led her to put\n",
      "her companion immediately at ease, but not only was she fond of\n",
      "experimenting with racial characteristics upon her own hidden\n",
      "possibilities, but she was intensely proud, and the English attitude had\n",
      "stung her more than once.\n",
      "\"Why should I please them?\" she thought, contemptuously. \"Let them\n",
      "please me.\"\n",
      "Her companion betrayed no eagerness to please her; and during the first\n",
      "ten minutes at table he talked to Gwynne about the late elections.\n",
      "Evidently, he too had emerged from the political fray triumphant. Isabel\n",
      "sat like a stately picture by Reynolds, and after her slow gaze had\n",
      "travelled over the dark full-length portraits of the kings and queens\n",
      "that had honored Capheaton, it dropped to the more animated faces in the\n",
      "foreground. The men were good-looking, with hardly an exception; judging\n",
      "by their carriage they might all have been army men, but as every word\n",
      "that floated to the head of the table was political, they possibly had\n",
      "followed their successful host's example and adopted an equally\n",
      "intermittent career. One or two of the women were almost as handsome as\n",
      "Lady Victoria, with their superb figures, their complexions of claret\n",
      "and snow, that blending of high breeding and warm palpitating humanity\n",
      "one never sees outside of England. But others within Isabel's range were\n",
      "too haggard for beauty, although one had a Burne-Jones face and her eyes\n",
      "gazed beyond the company with an expression that made her seem pure\n",
      "spirit; but she too looked tired, delicate, curiously overworked.\n",
      "Opposite Isabel was a tall buxom young woman of the purest Saxon type,\n",
      "who was talking amiably with the man on her right, and occasionally\n",
      "shaking with deep and silent laughter; her intimate casual manner, her\n",
      "slight movements, her accentuation, manifestly bred in the bone.\n",
      "Suddenly it was borne in upon Isabel's always sensitive consciousness\n",
      "that she was the only haughty and reserved person present, and she felt\n",
      "provincial and laughed frankly at herself. The lady across the table\n",
      "claiming the attention of the host, she turned to her own partner. Her\n",
      "black eyelashes were long, and under their protecting shadow she swept a\n",
      "glance at the card above the young man's plate. It was inscribed, \"Lord\n",
      "Hexam.\" She saw her opportunity and asked, ingenuously:\n",
      "\"How can you be a member of the House of Commons?\"\n",
      "He looked up from his fish and replied, somewhat cuttingly, \"By\n",
      "contesting a borough and getting elected.\"\n",
      "\"But I thought a peer could not be in the House of Commons.\"\n",
      "\"He can't.\"\n",
      "\"Then how can you be?\"\n",
      "\"I am not a peer.\" He looked very much annoyed.\n",
      "\"But you are Lord Hexam.\"\n",
      "He answered, sulkily: \"I happen to be the son of a peer.\"\n",
      "\"Are you irritated because I know nothing about you?\" asked Isabel,\n",
      "cruelly. \"Do you suppose I have wasted my time in England reading\n",
      "Burke?\"\n",
      "\"No, there are too many sights,\" he replied, more cruelly still.\n",
      "\"They are far more interesting than most of the people I have met.\" Then\n",
      "she changed her tactics and smiled upon him; and when she smiled she\n",
      "showed a dimple hardly larger than a pin's head at one corner of her\n",
      "flexible mouth. For the first time he looked under her eyelashes into\n",
      "the odd blue eyes, with their dilated pupils and black rim edging the\n",
      "light iris. He suddenly realized that she was beautiful, in spite of the\n",

      "return.\n",
      "\"I am afraid I was rude. But I am really shy, and you quite took it out\n",
      "of me. I am more afraid of the American girl than of anything on earth.\"\n",
      "\"How did you know I was an American?\"\n",
      "\"By your accent.\" He laughed good-naturedly. \"Now I am even with you.\"\n",
      "\"Well, you are. Californians pride themselves upon having no accent.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, it is not nearly so bad as some. But it is there all the same. Not\n",
      "a twang nor a drawl, but--well--every country has its unmistakable\n",
      "stamp.\"\n",
      "\"Well, I have no desire to be taken for anything but an American,\" she\n",
      "said, defiantly. \"A Californian, that is. After all, we are quite\n",
      "different. But we do have an appalling variety of accents in the United\n",
      "States. I have lived abroad long enough to discover that. When I am an\n",
      "old maid I am going to mount the platform and preach the training of the\n",
      "voice in childhood. I have taken a violent dislike to more than one\n",
      "clever American man merely because he trailed his voice through his\n",
      "nose. I don't mind our vices being criticised as much as our crudities.\"\n",
      "\"I never before heard an American girl make a remark that indicated the\n",
      "least interest in her country--even when--pardon me--they brag. They\n",
      "generally give the impression that they don't even know who happens to\n",
      "be the President of the moment. Somehow, you look as if you might.\"\n",
      "\"I was brought up by a man, and my uncle was a great politician in a\n",
      "small way. That is to say he was identified with country politics only,\n",
      "but he and my father were everlastingly discussing the national issues.\n",
      "Of course you have only met girls from the great cities, where the men\n",
      "are too busy making money to take any interest in public affairs. The\n",
      "women rarely hear them mentioned, practically forget there are such\n",
      "affairs--except on the Fourth of July, which they resent as a personal\n",
      "grievance. I have met scores of them in Europe. To know anything of\n",
      "politics they regard as the height of bad form.\"\n",
      "\"Sometimes I wish that our women would let them alone for a while. That\n",
      "is my sister over there,\" indicating the lady with the Burne-Jones face.\n",
      "\"She has worn herself to a shadow working for her husband, who is in the\n",
      "House, and she is heart and soul in politics--which she regards as a\n",
      "sort of divine mission. She is on several committees, is far more useful\n",
      "to her husband than his secretary, for she has the gift of style--and no\n",
      "one would accuse Rex of that--and during an election she never rests.\n",
      "Besides which, of course she has her little family, the usual number of\n",
      "establishments to look after, and great social pressure. I always\n",
      "maintain that our women are of immense service to us, but many of them\n",
      "are physically unfit. I expect to see my sister go to pieces any day,\n",
      "and as she is little short of an angel it worries me.\"\n",
      "\"She does look angelic,\" said Isabel, sympathetically. \"Is that what is\n",
      "the matter with the rest of them?--the thin ones, I mean?\"\n",
      "\"Generally speaking. The thinnest is my cousin. I went in for a cup of\n",
      "tea a week or two before the end of last session. There were several of\n",
      "us about the tea-table when a footman entered and muttered something to\n",
      "her, and with a vague word of apology she left the room and did not\n",
      "return for half an hour. I thought the baby must be dying, and was about\n",
      "to ring, when she reappeared and remarked that she had been sitting at\n",
      "the telephone listening to a paper her husband had just finished on one\n",
      "of the questions before the House. Some of them stand it better.\" He\n",
      "indicated a fair beautiful creature with a determined profile and deep\n",
      "womanly figure. \"There is Mrs. Sefton, for instance. She presides at\n",
      "committee meetings--she is great on colonial politics--for three or four\n",
      "hours at a time, and always sails out as fresh as a rose; but she has\n",
      "buried her husband and entertains when and whom she chooses. Lady\n",
      "Cecilia opposite understands politics as well as any woman in England,\n",
      "but does not go in for them--Spence isn't in the House; that may account\n",
      "for it!\"\n",
      "\"Your fashionable women do not in the least resemble ours,\" said Isabel,\n",
      "meditatively. \"They are far more like the women of our small towns.\"\n",
      "\"What!\"\n",
      "\"It sounds paradoxical, but it is more than half true. Say two-thirds;\n",
      "the other third is all in favor of your women, for obvious reasons. But\n",
      "those I speak of, the best women of every small town, are constantly\n",
      "active in civic affairs. Most of the sanitary improvements and the\n",
      "educational, all schemes for parks and better streets, come from them.\n",
      "There is no village too small to have its 'Woman's Improvement Club.'\n",
      "And it is the women that have saved all the historical buildings in the\n",
      "country from destruction.\"\n",
      "\"I thought they went in for Browning Societies.\"\n",
      "\"Doubtless you would scorn really to know anything of American humor.\n",
      "Perhaps our comic papers have never heard of the Improvement Clubs, or\n",
      "find nothing in them that is humorous. Not that I would decry the\n",
      "Browning Clubs, nor any literary clubs, however crude. It is all in the\n",
      "line of progress. 'Culture' is a tempting morsel for the jokemaker, but\n",
      "as an alternative for dull domesticity and the vulgar inanities of\n",
      "gossip it is not to be despised.\"\n",
      "\"By Jove, you are right,\" said Hexam, not without warmth.\n",
      "\"Is my fair cousin converting you to something?\" asked the host. His\n",
      "voice had been little heard, and he looked sulky.\n",
      "\"Cousin?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, he is my cousin,\" said Isabel, with the accent of resignation.\n",
      "Hexam laughed. Gwynne looked as if the grace of humor had been left out\n",
      "of him. Isabel, innocent and impassive, turned her eyelashes upon her\n",
      "partner. \"I was quite wild to meet my cousin,\" she went on, in the\n",
      "toneless voice that contrasted so effectively with her occasional\n",
      "extravagance of speech; \"and now I find him the precise image of my\n",
      "uncle Hiram, who never spoke to me except to say: 'Little girls should\n",
      "be seen and not heard,' or 'Run off to bed now, little one.'\"\n",
      "Without repitching her voice she yet infused it with a patronizing\n",
      "masculinity that once more startled Hexam into laughter, and caused a\n",
      "silent convulsion in the massive frame of Lady Cecilia Spence.\n",
      "\"She knows that was a bit of vengeance,\" thought Isabel. \"But of course,\n",
      "manlike, he'll never suspect it.\" She turned her deep thoughtful gaze\n",
      "full upon her cousin. His eyes were glittering under their heavy lids.\n",
      "He replied, suavely:\n",
      "\"I hope you will find us more polite--if less picturesque. I cannot\n",
      "flatter myself that my likeness to your uncle Hiram extends that far.\n",
      "'Precise image'--is not that perhaps a bit of national exaggeration?\"\n",
      "\"Well, I take that back,\" said Isabel, sweetly. \"But you really might be\n",
      "his son instead of his second cousin.\"\n",
      "\"Perhaps that accounts for a good many things,\" said Lady Cecilia. \"You\n",
      "know, Jack, I have always said there was something exotic about you. You\n",
      "are much too energetic and progressive for this settled old country. If\n",
      "you had been born in America I suppose you would have been president at\n",
      "the earliest moment the constitution permitted.\"\n",
      "He hesitated a moment, then delivered himself of a bombshell. \"I was\n",
      "born in America,\" he said.\n",
      "His eyes moved slowly from one stupefied face to another. \"As I left at\n",
      "the age of five weeks I can hardly claim that the incident left an\n",
      "indelible impress. But the fact remains that I should be eligible for\n",
      "the presidency if I chose to become an American citizen.\"\n",
      "Isabel looked at her relative with an accession of interest; he had\n",
      "suddenly ceased to be an alien, become in a measure a personal\n",
      "possession. \"Come over and try it,\" she said, impulsively. \"_There_ is a\n",
      "career worth while! A young country as full of promise as of faults!\n",
      "Think of the variousness of achievement! England's history is made. If\n",
      "you are all they claim, you might really make history in the United\n",
      "States. If I only had a brother--\" Her eyes were flashing for the first\n",
      "time. \"However--they say you love the fight. It is far more difficult to\n",
      "become a president of the United States than a prime-minister of\n",
      "England, for with us family influence counts for nothing.\"\n",
      "\"I am afraid I have not the qualities that do count. To be as frank as\n",
      "yourself--I don't think I could stand your politics.\"\n",
      "\"But think of the excitement of really sounding your capacities!\"\n",
      "Impersonality was an achievement with Isabel and she could always\n",
      "command it. \"You can never do that here, no matter how brilliant your\n",
      "success. There must always be the question of how far you would have\n",
      "gone without your family, and friends of equal power. The ugliest lesson\n",
      "of life is its snobbishness. Even when the herd can expect no return, a\n",
      "blind instinct--doubtless an inheritance from the days when there were\n",
      "but two classes--drives it to beat the drums for the socially elect. We\n",
      "have enough of that in America, heaven knows, but the best thing that\n",
      "can be said of American politics is that they are free of it. Besides,\n",
      "if our politics are bad, so much the better for you. You might do for\n",
      "the United States what your English great-grandfather helped to do for\n",
      "this country in 1832. You might be another 'Great Revolutioner,' like\n",
      "your still more illustrious ancestor, Sam Adams. You'll never, never\n",
      "have such an opportunity to become a great historical figure over here,\n",
      "for English dissatisfaction hardly counts, and in the United States\n",
      "there are increasing millions that demand reform, a closer approach to\n",
      "the ideal republic promised by their ancestors, and the man for the\n",
      "hour.\"\n",
      "The angry glitter had left his eyes and he was looking at her with\n",
      "interest and curiosity. He respected her courage and obvious power to\n",
      "rise above the personal attitude of her sex.\n",
      "\"I dislike intensely many things in your country,\" he said, slowly; \"but\n",
      "I will confess that it interests me greatly. If it has failed in some of\n",
      "its original ideals it has at least continued to be a republic for more\n",
      "than a century; and when one considers its enormous size and conflicting\n",
      "elements--for I suppose you will not claim that you are a homogeneous\n",
      "race--that is very inspiring! It makes one believe that fundamentally\n",
      "the country must be sound--that unswerving fidelity to an ideal. It is a\n",
      "great thing! a stupendous thing! I wish I knew that I should live to\n",
      "see England, all Europe, a republic. There is no other state fit for\n",
      "self-respecting men--that voice in the selection of their own rulers.\"\n",
      "\"By Jove, Jack!\" cried Lord Hexam. \"I never heard you go as far as that\n",
      "before.\"\n",
      "\"Possibly you never will again. I have no desire to rank with those\n",
      "brilliant failures that are born before their time, and no intention of\n",
      "wasting my energies on the unattainable. Moreover, radicals and\n",
      "socialists per se are merely a nuisance. The Liberal party is the only\n",
      "choice in England to-day, and when I get it at my back, I can, at least,\n",
      "after I have led it to a stronger position, fight for the soundest of\n",
      "the extremist dogmas, as well as for the reorganization of the House of\n",
      "Peers. Hereditary legislation in the twentieth century and the most\n",
      "civilized country in the world! Why not an hereditary army and navy?\n",
      "Russia has few greater anachronisms. And when one thinks of the careers\n",
      "it has ruined! Look at Barnstaple.\"\n",
      "The two men plunged into discussion, and Isabel, her eyes expressing a\n",
      "polite interest, studied the face of her cousin. She appreciated for the\n",
      "first time something of its power. A brief illumination of his eyes had\n",
      "betrayed the soul of the idealist; a passion that in a less sound mind\n",
      "might result in fanaticism. He was talking with none of the fiery\n",
      "enthusiasm that made him so irresistible a public speaker, but his\n",
      "negative suggestion of vitality, of mature thought, his very lack of\n",
      "every-day magnetism, fascinated her; not the woman, but the acute,\n",
      "receptive, and antagonistic intelligence. As he sat there talking, with\n",
      "hardly a change of expression in his voice or on his cold face, faintly\n",
      "sneering, he seemed to be holding his powers in solution; to have\n",
      "resolved them for the time being into their elements, that they might\n",
      "rest and recuperate. While no doubt in first-rate physical condition, he\n",
      "looked as if he had not a red corpuscle in his body, and this very\n",
      "contrast to the warm full-blooded people surrounding him gave him a\n",
      "distinction of his own, the distinction of pure brain independent of\n",
      "those auxiliaries that few public men have been able to dispense with.\n",
      "It was obvious that he was too self-centred, too haughtily indifferent,\n",
      "or too spoilt, to make any effort in private life to charm or bewilder;\n",
      "when he vanquished from the platform it was by the awakened rush of the\n",
      "forces within him; and this very indifference, this contemptuous\n",
      "knowledge of his mighty reserves, this serene faith in his star,\n",
      "invested his personal unattractiveness with a formidable significance.\n",
      "Isabel's imagination dilated him into a disembodied intellect surrounded\n",
      "by mere statues of human flesh. As she left the dining-room the illusion\n",
      "vanished. She liked him less than ever, nevertheless wished that he were\n",
      "her brother and the rising star in American politics.\n",
      "V\n",
      "As the women entered a large room on the opposite side of the central\n",
      "hall, where coffee was to be served, Flora Thangue laid her hand\n",
      "deprecatingly on Isabel's arm. \"I was so sorry not to be able to wait\n",
      "for you,\" she said. \"But I had a distracted note from Vicky at eight\n",
      "asking me to dress as quickly as I could and see if the cards on the\n",
      "table were all right: the new butler is rather a muff, and such a\n",
      "martinet the footmen dare not interfere. I was delighted to see that\n",
      "Jack had taken charge of you. What do you think of our infant prodigy?\"\n",
      "\"I have had little chance to think anything,\" said Isabel, evasively.\n",
      "\"Is he the typical Englishman--I mean apart from his peculiar gifts?\"\n",
      "\"Only in certain qualities. You see he has Celtic blood in him: of\n",
      "course the Gwynnes had their origin in Wales; and then he is one-fourth\n",
      "American, isn't he? I can't say how far that inheritance has influenced\n",
      "his character, but there is no doubt about the Celtic. Outwardly he is\n",
      "even more impassive than the usual Oxford product, and if he had been\n",
      "born a generation earlier he would have had all sorts of affectations.\n",
      "But affectation, thank heaven, is out of date. We wouldn't tolerate a\n",
      "Grandcourt five minutes. Whom should you like to talk to? You will have\n",
      "enough of me.\"\n",
      "\"I am sure there is no one I shall like half so well,\" said Isabel,\n",
      "truthfully; and Flora loved her for not being gracious. \"I think I\n",
      "should like to know Mrs. Kaye.\"\n",
      "\"If you ever do, please give me the benefit of your investigations.\n",
      "There are as many opinions of her as there are of cats. Vicky believes\n",
      "in her and I don't. Jack is in love with her--with certain of his Celtic\n",
      "instincts gone wrong.\"\n",
      "She led Isabel over to Mrs. Kaye, who sat alone on a small sofa, sipping\n",
      "her coffee and absently puffing at a cigarette. She was exquisitely\n",
      "dressed and jewelled, and her little figure was round and symmetrical;\n",
      "but nothing could obscure the ignoble modelling of her face. She might\n",
      "have been misunderstood for a housemaid masquerading had it not been for\n",
      "an air of assured power, a repose as monumental as that of a Chinese\n",
      "joss.\n",
      "She had cultivated a still radiance of expression which, when she\n",
      "thought it worth her while, broke into a tender or brilliant smile;\n",
      "although even then her large, ripe mouth retained a hint of the\n",
      "austerity her strong will had imposed upon it--to the more complete\n",
      "undoing of the masculine host. She smiled graciously as Miss Thangue\n",
      "murmured the introduction and moved away, but did not offer the other\n",
      "half of the sofa, and Isabel fetched a chair.\n",
      "\"You are the American cousin, of course,\" she said, with a slight lisp.\n",
      "\"We were all talking about you down at our end of the table, but I could\n",
      "not see you until just now. I long to go to America, your novels\n",
      "interest me so much. But one is always so busy--one never gets time for\n",
      "the Atlantic. Lady Victoria says you come from that wonderful country,\n",
      "California, but of course you know New York and Newport still better.\n",
      "All Americans do.\"\n",
      "\"I have never seen Newport, and passed exactly a week in New York before\n",
      "sailing.\"\n",
      "Mrs. Kaye's expressive eyes, which had dwelt on Isabel with flattering\n",
      "attention, fell to the tip of her cigarette. \"No? I thought that all\n",
      "smart Americans came from that sacred precinct.\"\n",
      "\"I am not in the least smart. I don't really _know_ half a dozen people\n",
      "in America outside of the county in which I have spent the greater part\n",
      "of my life--not even in San Francisco, where I was born.\" Isabel held\n",
      "her cigarette poised in one slender hand, letting her eyes fall\n",
      "deliberately on the broad back and flat nails of the exquisitely kept\n",
      "section on Mrs. Kaye's lap. \"So far, in my small social ventures I have\n",
      "felt the necessity of little beyond good manners and a small independent\n",
      "income. This is my first excursion into the great world, and of course\n",
      "my cousin is too secure in her position to care whether I am smart or\n",
      "not. Miss Thangue, the only other woman I have talked with, is far too\n",
      "amiable and well-bred. Am I to understand that I shall be tried by New\n",
      "York measurements and found wanting?\"\n",
      "\"Oh no!\" Mrs. Kaye's bright color had darkened. \"On the contrary, the\n",
      "English are always rather amused at American distinctions. It only\n",
      "happens that all my friends are New-Yorkers.\"\n",
      "She was a very clever woman, for snobbery had blunted and demoralized\n",
      "only one small chamber of her brain, and she had as comprehensive a\n",
      "knowledge of the world as any woman in it. Nevertheless, as her powerful\n",
      "magnetic eyes met the ingenuous orbs opposite, she was unable to\n",
      "determine whether the barbed words, quivering in a sore spot, had been\n",
      "uttered in innocence or intent. \"Of course one doesn't meet so many\n",
      "Americans, after all. Naturally, the New-Yorkers bring the best\n",
      "letters.\" She paused a moment as if ruminating, then delivered herself\n",
      "of an epigram: \"New York is the great American invention for separating\n",
      "the wheat from the tares.\"\n",
      "\"Indeed!\" Isabel was too surprised to strike back.\n",
      "\"It is well known that it is one of the most exclusive social bodies in\n",
      "the world. You have far less difficulty over here.\"\n",
      "\"That may be merely owing to the fear that affects all new social\n",
      "bodies. I have the honor to know the leader of society in St. Peter--a\n",
      "town of ten thousand inhabitants near my own--and she is frightfully\n",
      "exclusive. She is so afraid of knowing the wrong sort of people that she\n",
      "is barely on nodding terms with the several thousand new-comers that\n",
      "have added to the wealth and importance of the town during the last ten\n",
      "years. Consequently, her circle is as dull as an Anglo-Saxon Sunday. I\n",
      "fancy the same may be said of New York, for its fashionable set is not\n",
      "large and its interests are far from various. From all I have heard,\n",
      "London society alone is perennially interesting, and the reason is,\n",
      "that, absolutely secure, it keeps itself from staleness by constantly\n",
      "refreshing its veins with new blood, exclusive only against\n",
      "offensiveness. Of course you are a daughter of a duke or something,\" she\n",
      "added, wickedly. \"Everybody here seems to be. Don't you feel that your\n",
      "ancestors have given you the right to know whom you please?--instead of\n",
      "eternally plugging the holes in the dike.\"\n",
      "In spite of her sharpened wits, Mrs. Kaye smiled radiantly into Isabel's\n",
      "guileless eyes. \"I am not the daughter of a duke; I wish I were!\" she\n",
      "exclaimed, with a fair assumption of aristocratic frankness. \"But your\n",
      "point is quite correct.\" Again she appeared to ruminate; then added:\n",
      "\"The British aristocracy is to society what God is to the\n",
      "world--all-sufficient, all-merciful, all-powerful.\"\n",
      "\"And she would sacrifice Him and all his archangels to an epigram,\"\n",
      "thought Isabel, who was somewhat shocked. \"How fearfully clever you\n",
      "are!\" she murmured. \"Do you think in epigrams?\"\n",
      "\"Epigrams? Have I made one? I wish I could. They are immensely the\n",
      "fashion.\"\n",
      "\"I should think you might have set it--\"\n",
      "She did not finish her sentence, for the ear to which it was addressed\n",
      "suddenly closed. Lady Cecilia Spence had sauntered up, and Mrs. Kaye\n",
      "hastily made room for her on the sofa, turning a shoulder upon Isabel. A\n",
      "faint change, as by the agitation of depths on the far surface of\n",
      "waters, rippled her features, and Isabel, summoning the impersonal\n",
      "attitude, watched her curiously. It was her first experience of the snob\n",
      "in a grandiose setting, but it was the type that had aroused her most\n",
      "impassioned inward protest all her life: the smallest circles have their\n",
      "snobs, and, like all the unchosen of mammon, she had had her corroding\n",
      "experiences. But her high spirit resented the power of the baser\n",
      "influences, and, with her intellect, commanded her to accept the world\n",
      "with philosophy and the unsheathed weapon of self-respect. In the\n",
      "present stage of the world's development it was to be expected that the\n",
      "pettier characteristics of human nature would predominate; and perhaps\n",
      "the intellectually exclusive would not have it otherwise.\n",
      "Mrs. Kaye, polite tolerance giving place to the accent of intimacy,\n",
      "began: \"Oh, Lady Cecilia, have you heard--\" and plunged into a piece of\n",

      "archaeological society of Rome, read deeply in Italian history and art,\n",
      "attended lectures at the Sorbonne, and spent nearly a year in Berlin,\n",
      "Dresden, Munich, and Vienna, studying that modern stronghold of dramatic\n",

      "sit at home if she read to him, and she had learned to read and dream at\n",

      "the ardor of novelty. The eternal interrogations had obtruded themselves\n",
      "in her unfortunate girlhood, and she had questioned the voiceless\n",
      "infinite, but angrily, with youth's blind rebellion against the\n",
      "injustice of life. The anger and rebellion had been comatose in these\n",

      "she envied the student girls in Munich with their absurd \"reform dress,\"\n",
      "their cigarettes and beer in cheap restaurants and theatres, their more\n",
      "than doubtful standards. Although she had her own private faith and\n",
      "never hesitated to pray for anything she wanted, she was not of those\n",
      "that can make a career of religion; her mind and temperament were both\n",
      "too complex, and she was unable to interest herself in creeds and\n",

      "lent a fatal clarity of vision; and although she had studied men as\n",
      "deeply as she dared, the result had but intensified the sombre threat of\n",

      "disappointment, at the first glimpse of his portrait, was so crushing\n",
      "that she had buried her sex under an avalanche of scorn.\n",

      "so brief and tremendous, the incidents so crowding and tense, the climax\n",
      "so hideous, that she had been stunned for a time, then emerged into her\n",
      "present state of tranquil and not unpleasant philosophy--when the\n",
      "present moment, if it contained distraction, was something to be\n",
      "grateful for; otherwise, to be borne with until the sure compensation\n",
      "arrived. The future had neither terror for her nor any surpassing\n",
      "concern, although all her old impersonal interest in life had revived,\n",
      "and she was still too young not to be very much like other girls when\n",
      "circumstances were propitious. And at last she had conceived--or\n",
      "evolved--a definite purpose.\n",
      "This morning she was living as eagerly as ever during her first deep\n",
      "months in Europe. The excitement of the evening still possessed her; she\n",
      "had held her own, received homage, lived a little chapter in an English\n",
      "novel; above all, she was young, she was free, she was no longer\n",
      "unhappy; and she loved the early morning and swift walking.\n",
      "It was Sunday; the shooting would not begin until the morrow; everybody\n",
      "except herself, apparently, still slept; the breakfast-hour was\n",
      "half-past nine. She walked down a long lane behind the lawns and entered\n",
      "the first of the coverts. There was a drowsy whir of wings--once--that\n",
      "was all. There was a glint of dancing water in the heavier shades, a\n",
      "rosy light beyond the farthest of the trees in the little wood where the\n",
      "delicate pendent leaves hung asleep in the sweet peace. There was not an\n",
      "expiring echo of her own wild forests here; nor any likeness to the\n",
      "splendid royal preserves of Germany and Austria, with their ancient\n",
      "trees, their miles of garnished floor, the sudden glimpse of chamois or\n",
      "stag standing on a rocky ledge against the sky as if drilled for his\n",
      "part. These woods had a quality all their own: of Nature in her last\n",
      "little strongholds, but smiling, serenely triumphant, of tempered heat\n",
      "without chill, above all, of perfect peace.\n",
      "Nothing in England had impressed Isabel like this atmosphere of peace\n",
      "that broods over its fields and lanes, its woods and fells, in the\n",
      "evening and early morning hours; the atmosphere that makes it seem to be\n",
      "set to the tune of Wordsworth's verses, and to keep it everlastingly\n",
      "old-fashioned and out of all relation to its towns. As she left the wood\n",
      "she saw a big hay-stack, as firm and shapely of outline as a house, not\n",
      "a loose wisp anywhere. A girl, bareheaded, was driving a cow across a\n",
      "field. A narrow river moved as slowly as if the world had never\n",
      "awakened. The road turned to her right and led to an old stone village\n",
      "with a winding broken street and several oak-trees, a pump, and a long\n",
      "green bench. It might have been the Deserted Village, for the English\n",
      "rise far later than the Southern races that have fallen so far behind\n",
      "them in importance and wealth. Beyond the village, on a rise of ground,\n",
      "was the church, its square gray tower crumbling down upon its ancient\n",
      "graves. In the distance were farms, coverts, another village, a gray\n",
      "spire against the blossoming red of the sky; and over all--peace--peace.\n",
      "Had anything ever really disturbed it? Would there ever be any change?\n",
      "England had been devastated to the roots, would be again, no doubt, but\n",
      "unless it became one vast London, it would brood on into eternity with\n",
      "the slight defiant smile of a beautiful woman in an enchanted sleep.\n",
      "\"Are you, too, an early bird?\"\n",
      "Isabel flew out of her reverie. Lady Victoria was approaching from a\n",
      "forking road. She wore a short skirt, leggings, and heavy boots; and she\n",
      "was bright, fresh, almost rosy from swift walking. \"I have gone five\n",
      "miles already,\" she said, smiling. \"But I believe you were sauntering.\"\n",
      "\"Only just now--to absorb it all. I, too, can do my five miles an hour,\n",
      "although Californians are the laziest people in the world about\n",
      "walking.\"\n",
      "\"Then if you are up to a sharp trot we'll go to that farthest village.\n",
      "My land steward has been telling me a painful tale about one of my young\n",
      "women, and I intend to ask her some embarrassing questions while she is\n",
      "still too stupid with sleep to lie.\"\n",
      "\"Your young women? Is all this your estate?\"\n",
      "\"It belongs to Strathland, but I have lived here since I married, and\n",
      "now the place is virtually Jack's. These people have been my particular\n",
      "charge for thirty years and will continue to be until my son marries.\n",
      "There are only about a hundred families on the estate altogether, but\n",
      "they keep one busy.\"\n",
      "\"I can't imagine you in the working role of the Lady Bountiful. Last\n",
      "night, at least, if I had written to my friend, Anabel Colton, I should\n",
      "have devoted pages to your more famous attributes, but I should never\n",
      "have thought of this.\"\n",
      "\"Indeed? If one could languish through life in the shell of a mere\n",
      "beauty that life would be a good deal simpler proposition than it is.\n",
      "Unfortunately there are complications, and, agreeable or not, one\n",
      "accepts them as one does enemies, husbands, stupid servants, and all\n",
      "other mortal thorns. But I am not uninterested in my people here, not by\n",
      "any means, and they bore me less than going to court and visiting my\n",
      "father-in-law. I watch them from birth, see that they are properly\n",
      "clothed and fed, that they go to school as soon as they are old enough,\n",
      "later that they find a situation here or elsewhere--those that have no\n",
      "work to do at home. My son gives the young men and women a complete\n",
      "wardrobe when they start out to win their way in life, and the details\n",
      "fall on me. It means correspondence, mothers' meetings, and all that\n",
      "sort of thing. Even during the London season I come down once a month.\n",
      "Of course it is a bore, but on the whole tradition is rather kind than\n",
      "otherwise in making life more or less of a routine.\"\n",
      "\"Wouldn't you miss it if your son married?\" Isabel wondered if this\n",
      "woman had really given her the impression of tragic secrets, unlimited\n",
      "capacities for both license and arrogance. In this early morning\n",
      "freshness there was hardly a suggestion of the woman of the world,\n",
      "barely of the great lady; and in the rich tones of her voice there was a\n",
      "genuine note of interest in her poor.\n",
      "\"Oh, I should always keep an eye on them; young wives have so many\n",
      "distractions. If I had to give them up--yes, of course it would mean a\n",
      "vacancy in my collection of habits; one side of me clings strongly to\n",
      "traditions and duty. The other--well, I'd like to be a free-lance in the\n",
      "world for a while--although,\" she added, with a sharp intonation, \"I\n",
      "don't suppose I should stay away from Jack very long. It is a great\n",
      "relief to have a vital interest in life outside one's self. You, of\n",
      "course, are not old enough to have discovered that; and, indeed, I am\n",
      "not always so sure that it is possible.\"\n",
      "Isabel did not ask her if she would not be jealous of the wife who must,\n",
      "if he loved her, take the greater part of all that her \"Jack\" had to\n",
      "give; she divined in this many-sided woman a quality in her attitude\n",
      "towards her son with which ordinary maternal affection had little in\n",
      "common. Her fine eyes flashed with pride at the mention of his name, and\n",
      "it was more than evident that he was her deep and abiding interest; but\n",
      "this keen and curious young student of life had never seen any one less\n",
      "maternal. Lady Victoria's attitude, indeed, might as reasonably be that\n",
      "of a proud sister or wife. When he was beside her she looked almost\n",
      "commonplace in her content. The moment he passed out of her sight some\n",
      "phase of individuality promptly lit its torch. Last night Isabel had\n",
      "seen her stand for half an hour as motionless as some ivory female\n",
      "Colossus, only her eyes burning down with slow voluptuous fire upon an\n",
      "adoring little Frenchman. She had looked like a Messalina petrified with\n",
      "the complications and commonness of the modern world; possibly with the\n",
      "burden of years, Isabel had added, in girlish intolerance of the wiles\n",
      "of which youth is independent. She had been far from falling under her\n",
      "spell, although not wholly repelled by the glimpse of this worst side of\n",
      "a woman far too complex to be judged off-hand. This morning she liked\n",
      "her suddenly and warmly, and, with the lightning of instinct, divined\n",
      "why she worshipped her son and still was willing to have him marry and\n",
      "swing aside into an orbit of his own. All she needed was a certain\n",
      "amount of his society, opportunities to work for him, the assurance of\n",
      "his success and happiness. He was a refuge from herself; in his\n",
      "imperious demands her memory slept, her depths were stagnant. But Isabel\n",
      "was still too young, in spite of her own experience, more than dimly to\n",
      "apprehend the older woman's attitude, and the innumerable and various\n",
      "acts and sufferings, disenchantments and contacts that had led up to it.\n",
      "Victoria seemed to her the most rounded mortal she had met, and yet with\n",
      "an insistent terror in the depths of her riven and courageous soul, the\n",
      "terror of the complete, the final disillusion. Between that moment and\n",
      "her too exhaustive knowledge of life stood the magnetic figure of her\n",
      "son, safeguarding, almost hypnotizing her. She was as incapable of\n",
      "jealousy as of aching vanity in the fact of a son whom the world was\n",
      "never permitted to forget. She had done with little things, and Isabel,\n",
      "with young curiosity, wondered in what convulsion the last of them had\n",
      "gone down.\n",
      "Lady Victoria, unconscious of the analytical mind groping to conclusions\n",
      "beside her, was revolving the midnight comments of Flora Thangue, and\n",
      "her own impressions of this American relative whose sudden advent, taken\n",
      "in connection with her eighteenth century beauty and undecipherable\n",
      "quality, wrought the impression of a symbolic figure swimming out of\n",
      "space. Lady Victoria was far too indifferent to analyze the problems of\n",
      "any woman's soul, but she was keenly alive to the vital suggestion of\n",
      "power in the girl, and of the strong will and intellect, the command\n",
      "over every faculty, evidenced in the strong line of the jaw, the stern\n",
      "noble profile, the calm searching gaze so difficult to sustain. None\n",
      "knew better than Victoria the value and rarity of a free and courageous\n",
      "soul. Such a woman must, when more fully developed, throw the whole\n",
      "weight of her character into the scales balancing for the few whom she\n",
      "recognized as equals and accepted as friends. If she had had \"some\n",
      "smashing love affair,\" as the more romantic Flora suggested, so much\n",
      "the better.\n",
      "She said, with a perfectly simulated impulsiveness:\n",
      "\"Of course you understand that I meant what I said last evening. And not\n",
      "merely a week; you must pay us a long visit, if it won't bore you. But\n",
      "the house will rarely be empty now that the shooting has begun, and\n",
      "there is always something going on in the neighborhood. Later comes the\n",
      "hunting, and I am sure you ride.\"\n",
      "\"Oh yes, I ride! I have spent about half my life on a horse. I want to\n",
      "stay more than I can tell you, but before long I must go home. The same\n",
      "safe old bank that has charge of your ranches looks after my small\n",
      "affairs, and I have a man on the farm that has been in the family for\n",
      "forty years; otherwise I should never have dared to leave my precious\n",
      "chickens; but Mr. Colton writes me that Mac is failing, and before the\n",
      "rainy season commences I must look into things myself.\"\n",
      "\"Chickens?\" said Lady Victoria, much amused. \"Do you raise chickens?\"\n",
      "\"Rather; and not in the back yard, neither. I have about a thousand of\n",
      "the most beautiful snow-white Leghorns with blood-red combs you ever\n",
      "saw; and I have incubators, runs, colony-houses, and all the rest of it.\n",
      "They are raised on the strictest scientific principles and yield me the\n",
      "greater part of my income. That is the reason I feel obliged to\n",
      "return--if Mac is no longer able--or willing--to get up at night. One\n",
      "must not neglect the chicks--the little ones. I doubt if real babies are\n",
      "more trouble. I don't mind telling you that I have resolved to make a\n",
      "fortune out of chickens, if only that I may be able to live as I should\n",
      "in San Francisco. But I must go back and do the greater part of the work\n",
      "myself.\"\n",
      "\"Make a fortune--out of chickens! How odd that sounds! Not in the least\n",
      "romantic, but rather the more interesting for that. But why don't you\n",
      "let your ranch for dairy and grazing purposes, as we do? They bring us\n",
      "in a very good income--have done, so far.\"\n",
      "\"There are about nineteen thousand acres in Lumalitas, and some forty\n",
      "thousand in the southern ranch. I possess exactly three hundred and\n",
      "thirty-two, forty-five of which are marsh. You have now nearly the whole\n",
      "of the original grants, for as my father and uncle sold or mortgaged\n",
      "portions--and could not pay--your agents bought in. You may remember.\"\n",
      "\"There is seldom any correspondence. Mr. Colton has always had a free\n",
      "hand--yes--I do recall--vaguely. So I am profiting at your expense. I am\n",
      "afraid that must seem unjust to you.\"\n",
      "\"Not in the least. I did not choose my paternal relatives, but I long\n",
      "since accepted them with philosophy. I am thankful to have anything. Why\n",
      "don't you go to California and look at your property?--live on it for a\n",
      "few years? You could make far more out of it if you ran it yourself. The\n",
      "lease of Lumalitas must expire very soon. I do wish you would come and\n",
      "pay me a visit, and--Mr.--what on earth am I to call him?\"\n",
      "\"Jack, of course,\" said Lady Victoria, warmly, although she would have\n",
      "been swift to resent the liberty had the new relative been so\n",
      "indiscreet.\n",
      "\"I never could manage Jack--never! I can't feel, see him, as Jack. I\n",
      "think Cousin Elton will do.\"\n",
      "\"Quite so. I shouldn't wonder at all if we went. Jack is rather keen on\n",
      "American politics, knows his Bryce--I suppose it is in the blood. He\n",
      "even takes in an American Review. I have always rather wanted to visit\n",

      "But we were entertained so delightfully in New York and Washington that\n",
      "before we realized what an American summer meant it was too hot to cross\n",
      "the continent, and we accepted an invitation to the Adirondacks,\n",
      "intending to return to England in the course of a month. But Arthur\n",
      "broke his leg, and by the time he was well again it was not safe for me\n",
      "to travel. So we rented a place in Virginia, where there was good sport,\n",
      "and there Jack was born. Here we are. Rest under that tree while I\n",
      "interview the erring maiden.\"\n",
      "VII\n",
      "Isabel sat on the bench under an ancient oak for half an hour or more,\n",
      "but took no note of the time. In rural America one always seems to hear\n",
      "the whir of distant machinery and responds to its tensity in the depths\n",
      "of some nerve centre; but in England's open the tendency is to dream\n",
      "away the hours, the nerves as blunt as in the tropics; unless, indeed,\n",
      "one happens to be so astir within that one rebels in responding, and\n",
      "conceives of ultimate hatred for this incompassionate arrogant peace of\n",
      "England.\n",
      "Isabel had been roused from her mood of unreasoning content by her\n",
      "contact with the older woman, but for a few moments her thoughts waved\n",
      "to and fro in that large tranquillity like pendent moss in a gentle\n",
      "breeze. There was a stir of life in the little village; a window was\n",
      "thrown open; a man came out to the pump and filled a bucket with water;\n",
      "a child cried for its breakfast; the birds were singing in the trees.\n",
      "But they barely rippled the calm. Isabel's eyes dwelt absently upon a\n",
      "white line along a distant hill-top, made, no doubt, by Caesar's troops;\n",
      "for she had heard that the mosaic floors of Roman houses had been\n",
      "discovered under one of the fields in the neighborhood. This\n",
      "information, imparted by Lord Hexam's cousin, Mrs. Throfton, a lady\n",
      "interested in neither Bridge nor gossip, had not excited her as it might\n",
      "have done before her archaeological experience at headquarters, but she\n",
      "was glad to recall it now, for that white road, sharply insistent in the\n",
      "surrounding green, was one of the perceptible vincula of history.\n",
      "It was all old--old--old; an illimitable backward vista. And she was as\n",
      "new, as out of tune with it as the motorcar flashing like a lost and\n",
      "distracted comet along that hill-top in a cloud of historied dust: she\n",
      "with her problems, her egoisms, the fateful independence of the modern\n",
      "girl. In a fashion she was one of the chosen of earth, but she doubted\n",
      "if the women who had toiled in these villages, or in centuries past had\n",
      "lived their lives in the mansions of their indubious lords, had not had\n",
      "greater compensations than she. Unbroken monotony and a saving sense of\n",
      "the inevitable must in time create for the soul something of the\n",
      "illimitable horizon of the vast level spaces of the earth.\n",
      "And she? At twenty-five she had lost her old habit of staring with\n",
      "veiled eyes into some sweet ambiguous future, her girlish intensity of\n",
      "emotion. But her theories, in general, were sound, and she had ticketed\n",
      "even her minor experiences. She knew that character was the most\n",
      "significant of all individual forces, and that if developed in strict\n",
      "adjustment to the highest demands of society, dragging strength out of\n",
      "the powers of the universe, were it not inborn, the book of one's\n",
      "objective future at least need never be closed prematurely by those\n",
      "inexorable social forces, which, whatever the weak spots on the surface\n",
      "of life, invariably place a man in the end according to his deserts. She\n",
      "had seen her father, with all his advantages of birth and talents, and\n",
      "early importance in the community, gradually shunned, shelved, dismissed\n",
      "from the daily life of steadier if less gifted men, almost unknown to\n",
      "the young generation. He had clung to certain strict notions of honor\n",
      "through it all, however, and at his death the county had experienced a\n",
      "spasm of remorse and attended his funeral; the sermon had been eloquent\n",
      "with masterly omissions, and even the newspaper that had vilified him in\n",
      "his days of political influence came out with an obituary, which, when\n",
      "included in some future county history, would give to posterity quite as\n",
      "good an impression of him as he deserved.\n",
      "And James Otis had had his virtues. One of his claims to redemption\n",
      "survived in his daughter. He had reared her in the strict principles and\n",
      "precepts of his New England ancestors, many of which are generally more\n",
      "useful in the life of a man. This early instillation, taken in\n",
      "connection with himself as a commanding illustration in subcontraries,\n",
      "had given Isabel a directness of vision invaluable to a girl in no haste\n",
      "to place her life in stronger hands. Whatever her dissatisfactions and\n",
      "disillusions, her road lay along the upper reaches; the second rate, the\n",
      "failures from birth, the criminal classes, far below. Her start in life\n",
      "was indefectible, and she knew that did the necessity arise to-morrow\n",
      "she could support herself and ask no quarter.\n",
      "Perhaps, she mused, she would be happier in the necessity, for the\n",
      "problem of roof and bread is an abiding substitute for the problem of\n",
      "what to do with one's life. But she had never known an anxious moment\n",
      "regarding the bare necessities, and although there was something\n",
      "pleasantly stimulating in the prospect of making a fortune and being\n",
      "able to live as she wished in the city of her birth--the only object for\n",
      "which she retained any passion in her affections--she smiled somewhat\n",
      "cynically at the modest outlook.\n",
      "Environments like the present were uplifting, almost deindividualizing,\n",
      "and there had been a time when she had known seconds in the face of\n",
      "nature's surprises that were distinct spiritual experiences. She\n",
      "believed they would return when she was in her own land once more, and\n",
      "Europe a book of fading memories. Her love of beauty at least was as\n",
      "keen as ever, and now that Europe was off her mind, leaving the proper\n",
      "sense of surfeit behind it, no doubt she would have a sense of actually\n",
      "beginning life when the time came to take an active part in it, and she\n",
      "assumed a position of some importance in her own community. She was far\n",
      "too sensible for ingratitude, and fully appreciated the gifts that life\n",
      "had so liberally dealt her. And she fully believed in work as the\n",
      "universal panacea. The mere thought of a busy future brought a glow to\n",
      "her heart. She rose with a smile as Lady Victoria emerged from the\n",
      "cottage at the upper end of the village.\n",
      "Lady Victoria was not smiling. Her brows were drawn, and she looked\n",
      "angry and contemptuous.\n",
      "\"The little idiot!\" she exclaimed, as they started briskly for home.\n",
      "\"This is the first failure I have had in ten years. That is one of my\n",
      "boasts. And I took particular pains with that girl. Now Jack will have\n",
      "the agreeable task of coercing the man into marrying her, for it appears\n",
      "that his ardor has cooled.\"\n",
      "Her brow cleared in a few moments, but she seemed to have had enough of\n",
      "conversation, and it was evident that words for words' sake, or as a\n",
      "flimsy chain between signposts of genuine interest, had no place in her\n",
      "social rubric. Isabel, who was equally indifferent, strode along beside\n",
      "her without so much as a comment, and so confirmed the good impression\n",
      "she had made on her mettlesome relative. As they approached the house,\n",
      "Lady Victoria turned to her with a smile that brought sweetness to her\n",
      "eyes rather than any one of her more dazzling qualities.\n",
      "\"I am generally in my boudoir at five,\" she said. \"Come in this\n",
      "afternoon for a chat before tea, if you have nothing better to do. Now\n",
      "run and get ready for breakfast.\"\n",

      "Whether or not Mr. Gwynne had made up his mind to follow his mother's\n",
      "advice and employ a new weapon in his siege of Mrs. Kaye, or whether,\n",
      "like common mortals, he was subject to the natural impulses of youth,\n",
      "the most novel of the guests of Capheaton found herself on his right in\n",
      "the informality of breakfast, and the object of his solicitude. He\n",
      "fetched her bacon and toast from the sideboard, and when he discovered\n",
      "that she did not like cream in her tea, carried her cup back to his\n",
      "mother and waited for the more pungent substitute. And then he actually\n",
      "made an effort to entertain her. There was a flicker of surprised\n",
      "amusement in the neighborhood, but Isabel accepted his attentions as a\n",
      "matter of course, assuming that the young gentleman felt refreshed after\n",
      "a night's rest in his own bed, or had awakened to a sense of her\n",
      "importance as a member of his family. It was not until she caught Mrs.\n",
      "Kaye's eye and read a contemptuous power to retaliate, that she\n",
      "experienced a certain zest in the situation. With the magnetism of\n",
      "intelligent interest in her own eyes, she turned to Gwynne with a\n",
      "question that betrayed a flattering acquaintance with one of his less\n",
      "popular books, then hung upon the monologue of which he promptly\n",
      "delivered himself. It was characteristic that he either contributed\n",
      "little to the conversation or monopolized it; and he reflected, as he\n",
      "talked of the personal experience which led up to the episode of her\n",
      "interest, that he had never before gazed into eyes at once so lovely and\n",
      "so fine. He disliked American girls, partly because they had shown no\n",
      "disposition to join the ranks of those that lived to spoil him, partly\n",
      "because he believed them to be shallow and cold. Some of the married\n",
      "women had attracted him, but not before they had lived long enough to\n",
      "develop the stronger qualities of the older races; he had his ideals and\n",
      "was not easily satisfied. He was deeply in love with Mrs. Kaye, for her\n",
      "brilliant subtle mind and powerful appeal to his passions had blinded\n",
      "him to her defects, and he was convinced that his heart had travelled to\n",
      "its predestined goal. Nevertheless, he decided that his new cousin, if\n",
      "as cold as the rest of her youthful compatriots, was worth cultivating\n",
      "for her intelligence and obvious talent for good-comradeship.\n",
      "But in a moment a subject was started that entirely diverted his mind\n",
      "and upset the lively tenor of the breakfast-table.\n",
      "\"Where is Lorcutt?\" asked some one, abruptly, referring to a brother of\n",
      "Lord Brathland, who had lost heavily and cheerfully at Bridge the night\n",
      "before.\n",
      "Isabel's eyes happened to have wandered to the face of the man opposite.\n",
      "To her surprise it became livid. He turned instantly to Gwynne, however,\n",
      "and said: \"I should have told you--I quite forgot--he asked me to make\n",
      "his excuses. He got a telegram--bad news--Bratty is dead.\"\n",
      "Involuntarily Isabel glanced at Mrs. Kaye; Flora had hinted to her of\n",
      "the lady's designs. That face for once was ghastly and unmasked, but the\n",
      "eyes were not glittering with grief.\n",
      "\"Impossible!\" she cried, sharply. \"Lord Brathland? Why--I saw him only\n",
      "two days ago, in London. He was as well as possible.\"\n",
      "The others barely noticed her. Their astonished eyes were fixed on the\n",
      "first speaker, Captain Ormond, who was sitting very erect, as if to\n",
      "receive the questions fired at him as a brave man faces the hiss of lead\n",
      "on the field.\n",
      "\"I know little,\" he replied; \"except that Brathland was suddenly\n",
      "attacked by appendicitis two nights ago and that an operation was\n",
      "immediately performed--\"\n",
      "\"Friday night!\" cried Mrs. Kaye. \"Why he spent an hour with me that\n",
      "afternoon, and was to dine with Lord Zeal and Lord Raglin and half a\n",
      "dozen other men that night--they all came up to London to talk over one\n",
      "of Sir Cadge Vanneck's mines. Why--I remember you were to be there.\n",
      "Surely Lord Brathland was well then?\"\n",
      "\"He was looking very seedy when he came in. I happened to sit next to\n",
      "him--told him he ought to go home. Finally he got so bad he decided\n",
      "that he would, and as he left the table he fainted. Several of us saw\n",
      "him to bed. He said he didn't want his family fidgeting him, and the\n",
      "surgeon said he would be all right in a few days. I thought he was out\n",
      "of danger when I came down last night, so said nothing about it to\n",
      "Harold.\"\n",
      "\"Was he taken home?\" asked Gwynne, whose eyes had never left Ormond's\n",
      "face.\n",
      "\"No--to Raglin's room up-stairs. The dinner was at the Club.\"\n",
      "\"I cannot understand why his family was not summoned at the last!\"\n",
      "exclaimed Lady Victoria.\n",
      "\"Well, there's only the old duke and Harold, you see. Dick is out in\n",
      "Africa. I suppose they didn't want to agitate the duke until the last\n",
      "moment and couldn't find Harold until this morning. Besides, Raglin was\n",
      "with him, and he is a relative, at least. It is awfully sudden. I have\n",
      "been upset ever since Harold woke me up this morning and told me; and\n",
      "hated to speak of it.\"\n",
      "\"Who was the surgeon?\" asked Gwynne.\n",
      "\"Ballast.\"\n",
      "\"Ballast? Who is he? Why not one of the big men, in heaven's name?\"\n",
      "cried Mrs. Kaye.\n",
      "\"Well--they were all out of town--naturally enough at this time of year.\n",
      "We had to take what we could get. No doubt Lester or Masten was\n",
      "telegraphed for later. I--all of us--left the affair in Raglin's hands.\"\n",
      "The company broke into general comment, and under cover of the confusion\n",
      "Isabel distinctly heard Gwynne demand:\n",
      "\"What's up your sleeve, Ormond?\"\n",
      "And the response: \"For God's sake, old chap, don't ask!\"\n",
      "IX\n",
      "Gwynne had never recognized the contingency of a serious rival in the\n",
      "affections of the woman he had elected to mate, and had he heard of the\n",
      "late Lord Brathland's attentions it would not have occurred to him that\n",
      "Mrs. Kaye could weigh a prospective dukedom against the reflected\n",
      "glories of his own career. He intended to be prime-minister before he\n",
      "was forty, and older and soberer heads shared his confidence. It was\n",
      "true that Mrs. Kaye was an emphatic Conservative--scorning even the\n",
      "compromise of Liberal-Unionism--and that so far he had been unable to\n",
      "convert her; but he did not take any woman's political convictions very\n",
      "seriously, knowing that they commonly owed their inspiration to social\n",
      "ambition, a desire for a career, or to marital comradeship. The latter\n",
      "he made no doubt would operate in his own case as soon as the lady gave\n",
      "him the opportunity to demand it as his right; and his sharp political\n",
      "discussions with her were among the spiciest of his experiences. She\n",
      "rarely expressed herself in every-day language; and although it had\n",
      "crossed his mind that epigrammatic matrimony might grow oppressive, he\n",
      "had reminded himself that her speech was but a part of a too cultivated\n",
      "individuality and would be unable to endure the strain of daily\n",
      "intercourse. Although he had in his composition little of the femininity\n",
      "that gives a certain type of man a sympathetic comprehension of women,\n",
      "his Celtic blood imparted a subtle understanding of their foibles of\n",
      "which he was but half aware. More than once this subconscious\n",
      "penetration had induced a speedy recovery from misplaced affections; but\n",
      "the toils of Julia Kaye, who piqued, allured, repelled, dazzled, now and\n",
      "again snubbed every one else for his sake, bound him helpless. He was\n",
      "grateful for his mother's abetment, although it somewhat surprised him;\n",
      "but his mother was the woman of whom he had the least comprehension.\n",
      "So far Mrs. Kaye had ignored his several proposals, but of this he\n",
      "thought nothing. He would have cared little for a woman to be had for\n",
      "the asking; and he rather welcomed any treatment that stirred the\n",
      "somewhat sluggish surfaces of his nature.\n",
      "He had determined, however, to force a definite answer from her during\n",
      "this visit, and although he was far too courteous a host to embarrass a\n",
      "guest, he knew that were Mrs. Kaye deliberately to grant him a private\n",
      "interview he should be at liberty to press his suit.\n",
      "Immediately after the hour in the smoking-room that followed breakfast,\n",
      "he started in search of her; but although many of the women were\n",
      "scattered throughout the lower rooms, reading, writing, gossiping, he\n",
      "saw nothing of his inamorata. Flora Thangue happened to be standing\n",
      "alone, and he went up to her impulsively.\n",
      "\"Do you know if Julia has gone to church?\" he asked, without\n",
      "circumlocution.\n",
      "\"She went to her room directly after breakfast. I fancy she is rather\n",
      "cut up over Lord Brathland's death,\" replied the astute Miss Thangue.\n",
      "\"Of course; we all are--poor Bratty! He was rather a bounder, but it is\n",
      "natural to recall his virtues. Flora, go and tell her I want her to come\n",
      "for a walk. I can't go to her room myself, and I don't care to send a\n",
      "servant.\"\n",
      "Miss Thangue reflected. Probably this was the most favorable moment for\n",
      "a repulse that he could have chosen. She was sincerely fond of him and\n",
      "distrusted Mrs. Kaye as much as she disliked her.\n",
      "\"Very well,\" she said. \"I will see what I can do.\"\n",
      "Mrs. Kaye admitted her promptly and presented an unstained front,\n",
      "although her color was lower than usual. She was a woman of too much\n",
      "natural and acquired poise to remain askew under any shock. But she had\n",
      "experienced an hour of mixed emotions in which a confused and wondering\n",
      "sense of defeat was paramount. It had left her a little aghast, for\n",
      "although she had met with the inevitable snubs in her upward course, she\n",
      "rarely permitted them to agitate her memory in these days when she had\n",
      "grown to believe herself one of the spoiled favorites of destiny; and\n",
      "her fibres were by no means sensitive. But this sudden blow was a\n",
      "reminder that fate had been capricious to spoiled darlings before. She\n",
      "had stood almost motionless before the window from the moment she had\n",
      "entered her room until Miss Thangue knocked at the door, and by that\n",
      "time she had repoised herself and set her heavy mouth in a hard line as\n",
      "she reflected upon her own will as a factor in any game with life.\n",
      "\"Jack wants you to go for a walk,\" announced Miss Thangue, who saw no\n",
      "occasion for subtlety.\n",
      "\"That means he intends to propose again,\" said Mrs. Kaye, in her\n",
      "carefully modulated voice. \"I don't know that I care about it. I have\n",
      "letters to write.\"\n",
      "\"Why not get it over? You could compel him to believe, if you chose,\n",
      "that you have no intention of marrying him, and it would be rather a\n",
      "kindness; he has so much else to think about, and he certainly should\n",
      "have a free mind before the opening of Parliament. If you really did\n",
      "Jack any harm,\" she added, deliberately, \"Vicky would never forgive\n",
      "you--nor a good many others.\"\n",
      "\"I wouldn't do him any harm for the world,\" said Mrs. Kaye, casting down\n",
      "her eyes and looking very young and innocent. \"But I should hate to give\n",
      "him up. After all, there is no one half so interesting. Well, I'll go\n",
      "down and have it over.\"\n",
      "A few moments later she joined Gwynne at the foot of the staircase, and\n",
      "they went out to the woods. She looked her best in a smart walking-frock\n",
      "of white tweed, and a red toque; for the tailor costume modifies where\n",
      "the elaborate accentuates.\n",
      "Her brilliant eyes melted as Brathland's name was mentioned; naturally\n",
      "at once.\n",
      "\"What a dreadful--shocking thing!\" she cried. \"I do not realize it at\n",
      "all. Poor dear, we were such friends--and I saw him only a few hours\n",
      "before. Have you heard anything more?\"\n",
      "\"Ormond ran off to town directly after breakfast--as if he were afraid\n",
      "of being asked too many questions. I have an idea that he kept the cat\n",
      "in the bag. I saw my cousin Zeal yesterday, and thought he looked as if\n",
      "he had something besides his health on his mind.\"\n",
      "\"Why?\" asked Mrs. Kaye, startled. \"What else could it be?\"\n",
      "\"Well, Bratty was rather a flasher,\" said Gwynne, innocently. \"The\n",
      "dinner may not have been at the Club at all, and there is a little\n",
      "chorus-girl that engaged the fickle Bratty's affections for a time, and\n",
      "proclaimed her desire for vengeance from the house-tops when he\n",
      "transferred himself to a rival at the Adelphi. She is a Neapolitan, and\n",
      "that sort may carry a stiletto even in prosaic old London. Or perhaps\n",
      "poor Bratty was despatched with the carving-knife. No wonder he didn't\n",
      "want his family. But whatever it was, he has paid the penalty himself,\n",
      "poor chap, and no doubt the matter will be hushed up.\"\n",
      "\"How disgusting! I don't want to think of human slums on this heavenly\n",
      "Sunday morning.\"\n",
      "\"Nor to be proposed to, I suppose?\"\n",
      "\"I don't mind, Jack dear.\"\n",
      "She looked girlish and very piquant. Jack took her hand. She did not\n",
      "withdraw it, and they walked silently in the shadowed quiet of the wood.\n",
      "His heart beat almost audibly. Never before had she given him such\n",
      "definite encouragement. He could think of nothing to say that would not\n",
      "sound banal to this woman of the ready tongue. But agitation unlocks\n",
      "wayward fancies and sends them scurrying inopportunely across the very\n",
      "foreground of the mind. The vagrant hope that she would not accept him\n",
      "in an epigram restored his balance, and he turned to her with his\n",
      "habitual air of confidence, albeit his eyes and mouth were restless.\n",
      "\"I want an answer to-day,\" he said, boldly. \"And there is only one\n",
      "answer I will take. I have let you play with me, as that seemed to be\n",
      "your caprice, and I love caprice in a woman. But there is an end to\n",
      "everything and I want to marry before Parliament meets.\"\n",
      "\"And you never thought I would not marry you?\" she asked, in some\n",
      "wonder.\n",
      "\"I have never faced the possibility of failure in my life. And you are\n",
      "as much to me as my career. I cannot imagine life without either.\"\n",
      "He suddenly put his hand under her chin and lifted her face; she was of\n",
      "tiny stature and this disadvantage in the presence of man was not the\n",
      "least subtle of her charms. \"Say yes quickly,\" he cried, and the\n",
      "strength of his will and passion vibrated to her through the medium he\n",
      "had established. But she pouted and drew back.\n",
      "\"Perhaps I want a career of my own. You would swallow me whole.\"\n",
      "\"You could become the most powerful woman in the Liberal party--have a\n",
      "salon and all the rest of it.\"\n",
      "\"I happen to be a Conservative.\"\n",
      "\"What has that to do with it? Or politics with love, for that matter?\n",
      "Tell me that you love me. That is all I care about.\"\n",
      "\"It is only during the engagement that love is all. Marriage is the\n",
      "great public school of life; the passions fall meekly into their proper\n",

      "below the faculties that distinguish the higher kingdom.\"\n",
      "\"Indeed? Well, I am sanguine enough to believe that we would prove the\n",

      "the long morning tedious had she been of a more sociable habit. Lady\n",
      "Victoria, Mrs. Throfton, and Lady Cecilia Spence went to church; all\n",
      "three, as great ladies, having a dutiful eye to the edification of\n",
      "humbler folk. Flora Thangue spent the greater part of the morning\n",
      "writing letters for her hostess, the men fled to the golf-links, and the\n",
      "rest of the women not engaged in vehement political discussion, or\n",
      "Bridge, were striding across country. Isabel, tempted by the charmingly\n",
      "fitted writing-table in her room, although an indolent correspondent,\n",
      "wrote a long and amply descriptive letter to her sister, which her\n",
      "brother-in-law, being more than usually hard up at the moment of its\n",
      "arrival, transposed into fiction and illustrated delightfully for a\n",
      "local newspaper. Then she roamed about looking at the pictures, testing\n",
      "her European education by discovering for herself the Lelys and Mores,\n",
      "the Hoppners, Ketels, Holbeins, Knellers, Dahls, and Romneys. She had a\n",
      "quick instinct for the best in all things, but cared less for pictures\n",
      "than for other treasures of the past: marbles, the architecture in old\n",
      "streets, hard brown schlosses on their lonely heights, the Gothic spaces\n",
      "of cathedrals, the high and fervent imaginations, immortal yet nameless,\n",
      "in the carvings on stone; the jewelled facades of Orvieto and Siena,\n",
      "the romantic grandeur of the Alhambra.\n",
      "She opened a door at the back of the central hall and found herself in a\n",
      "pillared corridor with a door at either end. Both rooms were open, and\n",
      "as a blue cloud hung about the entrance to the left, she turned to what\n",
      "proved to be the library of Capheaton. It was a square light apartment,\n",
      "with the orthodox number of books, but with so many desks and\n",
      "writing-tables that it looked more like the business corner of the\n",
      "mansion. Here, indeed, as Isabel was to learn, Lady Victoria held daily\n",
      "conference with her housekeeper and stewards, interviewed the women of\n",
      "the tenantry, and those active and philanthropic ladies of every\n",
      "district that aspire to carry the burdens of others. Here Gwynne kept\n",
      "his Blue Books and thought out his speeches, but it was not a favorite\n",
      "room with the guests.\n",
      "Isabel had found many books scattered about the house, solid and\n",
      "flippant, old and new, but nothing by her host. She rightly assumed that\n",
      "his works would be disposed for posterity in the family library, and\n",
      "found them on a shelf above one of the large orderly tables. As a matter\n",
      "of fact she had read but two of his books, and she selected another at\n",
      "random and carried it to a comfortable chair by the window. The work was\n",
      "an exposition of conditions in one of the South African colonies,\n",
      "containing much criticism that had been defined by the Conservative\n",
      "press as youthful impertinence, but surprisingly sound to the\n",
      "unprejudiced. What had impressed Isabel in his other books and claimed\n",
      "her admiration anew was his maturity of thought and style; she saw that\n",
      "this volume had been published when he was twenty-four, written,\n",
      "doubtless, when he was a year or two younger. She felt a vague pity for\n",
      "a man that seemed to have had no youth. Since his graduation from\n",
      "Balliol in a blaze of glory he had worked unceasingly, for he appeared\n",
      "to have found little of ordinary recreation in travel. She wondered if\n",
      "he would take his youth in his bald-headed season, like the self-made\n",
      "American millionaire.\n",
      "His style, pure, lucid, virile, distinguished, might have been the\n",
      "outcome of midnight travail, or, like his eloquence on the platform, a\n",
      "direct flight from the quickened brain. It certainly bore no resemblance\n",
      "to his amputated table talk. But in a moment she dismissed her\n",
      "speculations, for she had discovered a quality, overlooked before, but\n",
      "arresting in the recent light of his cold arrogance and haughty\n",
      "self-confidence. Behind his strict regard for facts and the keen insight\n",
      "and large grasp of his subject, which, without his evident care for the\n",
      "graces, would have distinguished his work from the dry report of equally\n",
      "conscientious but less gifted men, was the lonely play of a really lofty\n",
      "imagination, and a noble human sympathy. As she read on, this warm\n",
      "full-blooded quality, tempered always by reason, grew more and more\n",
      "visible to her alert sense; and when the fires in his mind blazed forth\n",
      "into a revelation of a passionate love of beauty, both in nature and in\n",
      "human character, Isabel realized what such a man's power over his\n",
      "audience must be; when this second self, so effectually concealed,\n",
      "suddenly burst into being.\n",
      "\"It is too bad a woman would have to live with the other!\" she thought,\n",
      "as she raised her eyes and saw Gwynne emerge from the woods with Mrs.\n",
      "Kaye. \"I cannot say that I envy her.\"\n",
      "\"By Jove, they have an engaged look!\"\n",
      "Isabel turned with a start, but greeted Lord Hexam with a smile. He was\n",
      "as yet her one satisfactory experience of the young English nobleman,\n",
      "whom, like most American girls, she had unconsciously foreshadowed in\n",
      "doublet and hose. Hexam was quite six feet, with a fine military\n",
      "carriage; he had been in the Guards and had not left the army until\n",
      "after two years of active service; his blue eyes were both honest and\n",
      "intelligent, and he was generally clean cut and highly bred.\n",
      "He drew up a chair beside Isabel and reflected that she was even\n",
      "handsomer than he had thought, with the sunlight warming the ivory\n",
      "whiteness of her skin, although it contracted the mobile pupils of her\n",
      "eyes; and that little black moles when rightly placed were more\n",
      "attractive than he had thought possible. They gave a sort of daring\n",
      "unconscious eighteenth-century coquetry to what was otherwise a somewhat\n",
      "severe style of beauty. But he was a man for whom a woman's hair had a\n",
      "peculiar fascination, and while they were uttering commonplaces at\n",
      "random his eyes wandered to the soft yet massive coils encircling\n",
      "Isabel's shapely head, and lingered there.\n",
      "\"Pardon me!\" he said, boyishly. \"But I always thought--don't you\n",
      "know?--that hair like that was only in novels and poems and that sort of\n",
      "thing. Is it all your own?\" he asked, with sudden suspicion.\n",
      "\"You would think so if you had to carry it for a day. I should have had\n",
      "it cut off long ago if it had happened to be coarse hair. It is an\n",
      "inherited evil of which I am too vain to rid myself. The early Spanish\n",
      "women of my family all had hair that touched the ground when they stood\n",
      "up. I have an old sketch of a back view of three of them taken side by\n",
      "side; you see nothing but billows of fine silky hair. But I have put it\n",
      "out of sight, as it looks rather like an advertisement for a famous hair\n",
      "restorer.\"\n",
      "\"I'd give a lot to see yours down. It's wonderful--wonderful!\"\n",
      "\"Well, I have promised a private view to some of the women. If Lady\n",
      "Victoria thinks it quite proper perhaps I'll admit you.\"\n",
      "\"I'll ask her for a card directly she comes home. Let it be this\n",
      "afternoon just after tea.\"\n",
      "\"I wonder if they really are engaged,\" said Isabel, who had been told\n",
      "that Englishmen never paid compliments, and was growing embarrassed\n",
      "under the round-eyed scrutiny. Gwynne and Mrs. Kaye had paused by a\n",
      "sundial.\n",
      "\"Who? Oh yes, I should think so, although there was some talk that poor\n",
      "Bratty--but no doubt that was mere rumor, or Mrs. Kaye wouldn't be on\n",
      "with Jack like that. By Jove, he is engaged. I never saw him look\n",
      "so--so--well, I hardly know what.\"\n",
      "\"Do you approve of the match?\"\n",
      "\"If my consent is asked I shall give them my blessing. He is the salt of\n",
      "the earth, although a bit lumpy now and then; and she is such a jolly\n",
      "little thing, full of genuine affection--just the wife for Jack.\"\n",
      "\"You believe in her, then?\" Isabel wondered, as many another has done,\n",
      "at the miasma that seems to rise and dim a man's perceptive faculties\n",
      "when he is called upon to estimate the worth of a fascinating woman.\n",
      "\"Rather! Don't you?\"\n",
      "\"She struck me as being one of the few people without a redeeming\n",
      "virtue. To be sure that has a distinction of its own.\"\n",
      "\"Oh!\" He wondered if so handsome a girl shared the common rancor of her\n",
      "age and sex against charming young widows.\n",
      "\"And the worst mannered,\" continued Isabel, who knew exactly what he\n",
      "thought. \"And plebeian in her marrow. I wish my cousin had chosen Miss\n",
      "Thangue or any one else.\"\n",
      "\"But he couldn't marry Flora,\" said the literal young nobleman. \"She\n",
      "hasn't a penny, and is the friend of all our mothers. But I'm sorry\n",
      "you've such a bad opinion of Mrs. Kaye. She's tremendously popular with\n",
      "us. I'm not one of her circle--retinue would be more like it; but I've\n",
      "always thought her the brightest little thing going, and I'm sure she\n",
      "wouldn't harm a fly.\"\n",
      "\"I'm sure she would do nothing so little worth her while. Well, there is\n",
      "no need for your eyes to be opened; but I wish that my cousin's might\n",
      "be. I suppose that you have the same faith in him that so many\n",
      "others--himself included--seem to have.\"\n",
      "\"Rather!--You are a most critical person. Haven't you?\"\n",
      "\"I think I have. In fact I am sure of it. That is the reason I have been\n",
      "wishing he were an American.\"\n",
      "He laughed boyishly. \"That is a good one! But we need him over here. You\n",
      "haven't the slightest idea how much. We get into a blue funk every time\n",
      "Zeal takes a cold on his chest. To quote Mrs. Kaye, 'A Liberal peer is\n",
      "as useful as a fifth wheel to a coach, and as ornamental as whitewash.'\n",
      "Clever, ain't it?\"\n",
      "\"I think people are touchingly easy to satisfy! I have been treated to\n",
      "several of Mrs. Kaye's epigrams and heard as many more quoted. It seems\n",
      "to me that nothing could be easier than the manufacture of that popular\n",
      "superfluity.\"\n",
      "\"Perhaps--with time to think them out beforehand. Anyhow, it's rather\n",
      "jolly to hear things you can remember.\"\n",
      "\"I should be the last to deny her cleverness,\" said Isabel, dryly. But\n",
      "being by no means desirous that he should find her too acid, she dropped\n",
      "her eyes for a moment, then raised two dazzling wells of innocence. \"I\n",
      "am tired of the subject of my cousin and Mrs. Kaye,\" she murmured. \"Are\n",
      "you as ambitious as Jack?\"\n",
      "\"No use.\" He stared helplessly down into the blue flood. \"There is no\n",
      "escape from the 'Peers' for me, although my father, I am happy to say,\n",
      "is as healthy as I am. But after the brain cells become brittle--one\n",
      "never knows. I too am a Liberal, and am getting in all the good work of\n",
      "which I am capable while there is yet time. I don't go as far as\n",
      "Jack--don't want to see the 'Peers' chucked. I have a strong reverence\n",
      "for traditions, and no taste whatever for democracy--that would be too\n",
      "long a step. And I think a man should be content to be useful, do the\n",
      "best he can, in his own class; and be loyal to that class whatever\n",
      "happens. Of course I understand Jack's point of view, because I\n",
      "understand him so well, and know that he would be the most maimed and\n",
      "wretched man on earth in the Upper House; but personally, I think one\n",
      "should be prepared to accept inherited responsibilities.\"\n",
      "And then, as they were both young, and mutually attracted, they found\n",
      "many subjects of common interest to keep them in the library until the\n",
      "gong summoned them to luncheon.\n",
      "XI\n",
      "Flora Thangue, after luncheon, took Isabel out in a pony cart, and\n",
      "although too loyal to gossip intimately about her patrons, incidentally\n",
      "directed a search-light into certain of their recesses; a light that was\n",
      "to prove useful to Isabel in her future intercourse with them, although\n",
      "it did not in the least prepare her for an experience that awaited her\n",
      "later in the day. Miss Thangue's mind was occupied at first with the\n",
      "obvious engagement of Gwynne and Mrs. Kaye.\n",
      "\"That woman was born to upset calculations!\" she exclaimed. \"Yonder is\n",
      "the castle of the dukes of Arcot. We are going over to a party to-morrow\n",
      "night. It really looks like a castle with all those gray battlements and\n",
      "towers, doesn't it? We don't call every tuppeny-hapenny villa inhabited\n",
      "by a nobleman a 'castle' as they do in Germany and Austria. Well--that\n",
      "clever little panther! I'd like to pack her into one of her own epigrams\n",
      "and bury her alive. I _know_ she was as good as engaged to Brathland.\n",
      "Now, having decided that, all things considered, Jack is the best match\n",
      "going--for everybody believes Lord Zeal to be worse than he is--well!\n",
      "there is something appalling in a woman who can adjust herself as\n",
      "quickly as that; whose caprices, sentiments, passions, all natural\n",
      "impulses, are completely controlled by her reason. I wish Vicky saw\n",
      "through her; she has so much influence over Jack, and such deadly\n",
      "powers of ridicule. But Vicky, like all spoiled women of the world, is\n",
      "as much the victim of the subtle flatterer as any man, and Julia Kaye\n",
      "has managed her beautifully. She considered Jack for a bit before she\n",
      "was sure of Brathland. Vicky's real reason for indorsing Julia\n",
      "Kaye--between us--is because she believes her to be one of that small\n",
      "and select band that can hold a man on all his various sides, and she\n",
      "wants to avoid the probability of an absorbing and possibly tragic\n",
      "liaison--like Parnell's, for instance--which might interfere with,\n",
      "perhaps ruin, Jack's career. That is all very well, as far as it goes,\n",
      "but I believe Julia Kaye to be so entirely selfish that when Jack finds\n",
      "her out he will sicken of life. I have had the best of opportunities to\n",
      "study women, and I have brought Jack up--I had the honor to be the\n",
      "highly idealized heroine of his calf-love, and have been more or less in\n",
      "his confidence ever since. In certain ways I understand him better than\n",
      "his mother does, for she has seen too much of the worst side of men, and\n",
      "is at heart too _blasee_ to have much respect for or knowledge of their\n",
      "spiritual side; and if I have ever had any maternal spasms in my\n",
      "virtuous spinsterhood they have been over Jack. Can't you help us out?\"\n",
      "she asked, turning suddenly to the stranger, to whom she was powerfully\n",
      "attracted. \"Are you as indifferent as you look?\"\n",
      "\"I have no idea! But although I should not in the least object to be\n",
      "cast for a part in this domestic drama, I don't care for it at the price\n",
      "of too much 'Jack.' To attempt to cut out Mrs. Kaye I should need a\n",
      "little genuine enthusiasm; and frankly, your beloved prodigy does not\n",
      "inspire it. I like Lord Hexam far better.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, Jimmy! He's a fine fellow, but only a type.\"\n",
      "\"He hasn't a rampant ego, if that is what you mean. And for every-day\n",
      "purposes--\" She shrugged her shoulders. \"I could endure and even be\n",
      "deeply interested in Elton Gwynne if he happened to be my brother and I\n",
      "could hook my finger in his destiny; but in any other capacity--no,\n",
      "thank you!\"\n",
      "\"Are you going to marry Jimmy?\"\n",
      "\"I did not even know he was not already married. Do you see nothing in a\n",
      "man but a husband over here? If I ever do marry it will not be before I\n",
      "am forty.\"\n",
      "\"That is rather long--if you see much of the world meanwhile! And Jimmy,\n",
      "although there is not much money in the family--about twenty thousand a\n",
      "year--would be a very good match. He will be Earl of Hembolt--a fine old\n",
      "title.\"\n",
      "\"You assume that such a plum may be pulled by the first comer.\"\n",
      "\"Rather not! But you Americans have such a way with you! What is more to\n",
      "the point, I never saw him so bowled over.\"\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Isabel, imperturbably, \"I will think of it. This English\n",
      "country and these wonderful old houses, with their inimitable\n",
      "atmosphere, appeal to me very strongly. I have more the feeling of being\n",
      "at home here than I had even in Spain, where I have roots. And socially\n",
      "and picturesquely, there is nothing to compare with the position of an\n",
      "English noblewoman.\"\n",
      "Flora turned her eyes frankly to the classic profile beside her. Isabel\n",
      "had removed her hat, and, framed in the heavy coils of her hair, her\n",
      "features impressed the anxious observer as even more Roman than early\n",
      "American; although had she but reflected she would have remembered that\n",
      "the type of the Caesars had its last stronghold in the United States of\n",
      "the eighteenth century. Isabel looked like a very young Roman matron,\n",
      "but her resemblance to the stately effigies in the galleries of Florence\n",
      "and Rome, strong in virtue or vice, was so striking that once more Flora\n",
      "longed for her support. A woman with such capabilities would be wasted\n",
      "in the role of a mere countess--but as the wife of an aspiring Liberal\n",
      "statesman! She devoutly wished that the American had arrived six months\n",
      "earlier, or that Brathland still lived.\n",
      "But she was a very tactful person and was about to drop the subject,\n",
      "when Isabel slowly turned her eyes. They looked so much like steel that\n",
      "for the moment they seemed to have lost their blue.\n",
      "\"I have made up my mind to do something to prevent this marriage,\" she\n",
      "announced. \"I do not know what, as yet. I shall be guided by events.\"\n",
      "And Flora devoutly kissed her, then gossipped pleasantly about the other\n",
      "guests and the people in the neighborhood. Isabel was curious to know\n",
      "something of the duchess she was to meet on the morrow.\n",
      "\"Does she really look like a duchess?\" she asked, so innocently that\n",
      "Flora laughed and forgot the Roman-American profile, and the fateful\n",
      "eyes that had given her an uncomfortable sensation a moment before.\n",
      "\"Well--yes--she does--rather. It is the fashion in these days not to--to\n",
      "be smart above all things, excessively democratic, animated, unaffected,\n",
      "clever. But our duchess here is rather old-fashioned, very lofty of head\n",
      "and expression. She has a look of floating from peak to peak, and\n",
      "although passee is still a beauty. To be honest, she is hideously dull,\n",
      "but as good a creature as ever lived, and all that the ideal duchess\n",
      "should be--so high-minded that she has never suspected the larkiest of\n",
      "her friends.\"\n",
      "\"Well, I am glad she looks the role. I have artistic cravings.\"\n",
      "They drove for an hour through the beautiful quiet green country, past\n",
      "many old stone villages that might have been the direct sequence of the\n",
      "cave era. An automobile skimmed past and the pony sat down on its\n",
      "haunches. Isabel had a glimpse of a delicate high-bred face set like a\n",
      "panel in a parted curtain.\n",
      "\"That is the duchess,\" said Miss Thangue. \"She wouldn't wear goggles for\n",
      "the world, and only gets into an automobile occasionally to please the\n",
      "duke. There is nothing old-fashioned about him.\"\n",
      "\"She looks as if her name ought to be Lucy,\" said Isabel, to whom the\n",
      "pure empty face had appeared like a vision from some former dull\n",
      "existence, and left behind it an echo of insupportable ennui.\n",
      "XII\n",
      "Isabel had looked forward all day to the promised talk with the somewhat\n",
      "formidable relative for whom, however, she had conceived one of those\n",
      "enthusiasms peculiar to her age and sex. Her wardrobe was barren of the\n",
      "costly afternoon gowns smart women affect, but she put on an organdie,\n",
      "billowy with many ruffles, that consorted with the season, at least.\n",
      "Blue cornflowers were scattered over the white transparent surface, and\n",
      "she possessed no more becoming frock. Had she been on her way to a tryst\n",
      "with Lord Hexam she would have thrust a rose in her hair, accentuated\n",
      "the smallness of her waist with a blue ribbon, the whiteness of her\n",
      "throat with a line of black velvet; but she had the instinct of dress,\n",
      "which teaches, among many things, that self-consciousness in external\n",
      "adornment provokes amusement in other women.\n",
      "She had not the least idea where to find Lady Victoria's boudoir,\n",
      "although a casual reference by Flora Thangue suggested that it was on\n",
      "the bedroom floor. She lost herself in the interminable corridors and\n",
      "finally ran into Elton Gwynne.\n",
      "\"Your mother expects me--where is her boudoir?\" she asked.\n",
      "He was at peace with the world, and answered, good-naturedly: \"I'll\n",
      "pilot you. Her rooms are over on the other side.\"\n",
      "\"You look as if you should be congratulated about something,\" she said,\n",
      "demurely. \"There are all sorts of rumors flying about.\"\n",
      "She had half-expected to be snubbed, but he was not in the humor to snub\n",
      "anybody. \"You can congratulate me!\" he said, emphatically. \"The most\n",
      "wonderful woman in the world has promised to marry me.\"\n",
      "\"I hope you will be happy,\" said Isabel, conventionally. She resented\n",
      "his sudden drop from his pedestal, for he looked sentimental and\n",
      "somewhat sheepish. Still, her youth warmed to his in spite of herself,\n",
      "and again he noticed with a passing surprise that her eyes were both\n",
      "lovely and intellectual. He was hardly aware that coincidentally his\n",
      "Julia's eyes met his mental vision with a glance somewhat too hard and\n",
      "brilliant, but he caught Isabel's hand and gave it a little shake.\n",
      "\"Thank you!\" he exclaimed. \"That was said as if you jolly well meant it.\n",
      "There are my mother's rooms.\"\n",
      "He went off whistling, and Isabel raised her hand and looked at it\n",
      "meditatively; his own had been unexpectedly warm and magnetic. She had\n",
      "imagined that his grasp would be cold and loose.\n",
      "He had indicated a private corridor, and she entered it and approached a\n",
      "door ajar. There was no response to her knock, but as she was expected,\n",
      "and Lady Victoria no doubt was still dressing, she pushed open the door\n",
      "and entered. The room was empty, but Isabel was instantly impressed with\n",
      "its reflection of an individuality, although of a side that had\n",
      "attracted her least. Here was none of the old-time stiffness of\n",
      "Capheaton, and there was a conspicuous absence of dead masters and their\n",
      "pupils. It was not a large room. The walls were covered with a Japanese\n",
      "gold paper to within four feet of the floor where it was met by a\n",
      "tapestry of Indian cashmeres, and from it was separated by a narrow\n",
      "shelf set thick with photographs in silver frames, and with odd and\n",
      "exquisite bibelots. On the walls were artists' sketches, and two or\n",
      "three canvases of the Impressionist and Secessionist schools, expressive\n",
      "of the ardent temperaments of their creators. In the place of honor was\n",
      "a painting of Salambo in the folds of her python.\n",
      "There were several deep chairs and a mighty divan covered with\n",
      "gold-colored cushions and a tiger-skin, whose mate was on the floor. The\n",
      "gloom of the afternoon was excluded by heavy gold-colored curtains, and\n",
      "the only, but quite sufficient light, filtered through an opalescent\n",
      "globe upheld by a twisted bronze female of the modern Munich school,\n",
      "that looked like nothing so much as Alice elongating in Wonderland.\n",
      "Isabel suddenly felt herself and her organdie absurdly out of place in\n",
      "this room with its enchantress atmosphere. She wished that Lady Victoria\n",
      "had made the appointment for the library, which was equally in tune with\n",
      "another side of her.\n",
      "She was even meditating a retreat, inexplicably embarrassed, when an\n",
      "inner door opened and Lady Victoria entered. She wore a tea-gown of a\n",
      "sort, black and yellow, open over the soft lace of a chemisette,\n",
      "although a dog-collar of tiny golden sequins clasped her throat. In her\n",
      "hair a golden butterfly trembled, and in that light she would have\n",
      "looked little older than her guest had it not been for the expression of\n",
      "her face. It was this expression that arrested Isabel even more than the\n",
      "toilette, as she moved towards the divan without a word of greeting. It\n",
      "looked as if it had been put on with the costume, both intended to\n",
      "express a mood of the wearer: which might have been that of a tigress\n",
      "whose ferocity was slowly awakening with the approach of the victim. The\n",
      "black eyes were heavy with the lust of conquest, the points of the mouth\n",
      "turned up more sharply than usual; there was an insatiable vanity in the\n",
      "commanding poise of her head. She was as little like the woman of the\n",
      "morning as the sun is like the midnight, and Isabel experienced a\n",
      "positive terror of her.\n",
      "Feeling sixteen and very foolish, she sank to the edge of a chair and\n",
      "muttered something about the charm of the room. Then, as Lady Victoria,\n",
      "who had arranged herself among the shining pillows, continued to stare\n",
      "at her with absolutely no change of expression, it dawned upon her that\n",
      "she had not been expected but that some one else was. With too little\n",
      "presence of mind left to retire gracefully and too much pride to appear\n",
      "to have ventured into the cave of Venus unasked, she managed to\n",
      "articulate her gratitude for the invitation of the morning.\n",
      "\"Oh!\" Lady Victoria's eyebrows expressed a flicker of intelligence. \"I\n",
      "hope you have managed not to bore yourself.\"\n",
      "Isabel plunged into an account of her drive, to which Lady Victoria, who\n",
      "had lit a long Russian cigarette, paid no attention whatever. Her\n",
      "expression was still petrified, except that she might have had the scent\n",
      "of blood in her slightly dilating nostrils.\n",
      "Suddenly the slow flame in her eyes burned upward, and Isabel, her head\n",
      "fairly jerking about, saw that a man had entered and was advancing\n",
      "rapidly across the room, his heavy eyes wide with admiration. It was the\n",
      "Frenchman whom Lady Victoria had honored with so much of her attention\n",
      "the evening before.\n",
      "He raised to his lips the pointed fingers negligently extended, and\n",
      "murmured something to which Lady Victoria replied in French as pure and\n",
      "fluent as his own; and in a low rich voice, with not an echo in it of\n",
      "her habitual abruptness or haughty languor.\n",
      "The Frenchman accepted a cigarette and a low chair opposite the divan,\n",
      "whose golden cushions seemed subtly to embrace the yielding flexible\n",
      "figure against them. Neither took the slightest notice of the third\n",
      "person beyond a muttered introduction and acknowledgment, and as the man\n",
      "embarked on a soft torrent of speech, bearing the burden of his\n",
      "beatitude in at last meeting the only Englishwoman whose fame in Paris\n",
      "was as great as among her native fogs, Isabel rose and retreated with\n",
      "what dignity she could summon. Then Lady Victoria, seeing that she was\n",
      "rid of her, and courteous under all her idiosyncrasies, rose with a long\n",
      "motion of repressed energy and accompanied her to the door, her hand\n",
      "resting lightly against the crisp organdie belt.\n",
      "\"Will you pour out the tea for me?\" she asked, sweetly. \"I doubt if I go\n",
      "down.\"\n",
      "No small part of her dangerous fascination lay in her sincerity. She\n",
      "really liked Isabel, although it was characteristic of her that she did\n",
      "not in the least care at what conclusions that puzzled young woman might\n",
      "arrive in a more solitary meditation.\n",
      "When Isabel found herself in the long cool corridor, set thick with\n",
      "gentle landscapes, and hunting squires, and dames haughty and humble,\n",
      "she drew a long breath of relief, as if she had escaped from a jungle.\n",
      "But she felt oddly wounded in her self-love, young and silly. She had\n",
      "thought herself old in the last three years, tremendously modern. What\n",
      "did she know? The easy morals of students in France and Germany had\n",
      "repelled her at first, but she had ended by accepting them as a matter\n",
      "of course, and had rather plumed herself upon her accumulating grains\n",
      "and blends of human nature. She felt a rush of contempt for their\n",
      "crudity. What children they were with their simple unmorality of\n",
      "artists, as ignorant of the real world as babes in a wood!\n",
      "When she reached her own room she astonished herself by bursting into a\n",
      "passion of tears. It was some time before she understood what had\n",
      "induced it. It was not that the illusions of youth had received a hard\n",
      "blow, for many of them had disappeared long since in Paris, when she had\n",
      "supported an American girl of decent family but too much liberty through\n",
      "the most desperate experience that a young woman, alone and friendless\n",
      "in a foreign city, well could have. The girl had died cursing all men\n",
      "and the folly of women, and after Isabel had buried her and the leading\n",
      "cause of her repentance, she returned to her lonely flat in a state of\n",
      "disillusion and disgust which seemed to encase her by no means\n",
      "susceptible heart in a triple panoply. This state of mind had lasted for\n",
      "at least three months. And there was little of which she had not\n",
      "abstract knowledge, nor had she lived a quarter of a century to learn\n",
      "for the first time of the license which the world permits to women so\n",
      "highly placed that they have come to believe themselves above all laws.\n",
      "But all her experience and abstract knowledge counted for nothing, and\n",
      "she had for the first time a sudden and complete appreciation of the\n",
      "evil of the world and of its odd association with even the higher\n",
      "virtues; of the fact that in the upper walks of life the balance was\n",
      "more nearly even than on planes where there existed scantier\n",
      "opportunities for development. There was no question that Victoria\n",
      "Gwynne was made on a magnificent plan, as capable of heroism, no doubt,\n",
      "as any of the salient women of history. She was an ornament in her\n",
      "world, useful, sympathetic, the author of much good, a devoted and\n",
      "inspiring mother. And yet there was no more question that this Frenchman\n",
      "was the last of a long line of favored adorers than that Victoria, for\n",
      "all her individualities, was but a type of her kind: a kind that was\n",
      "sufficiently distinct from the hundreds of wholly estimable women that\n",
      "were proud to know her, or accepted her as a matter of course.\n",
      "And even these good women? Had they not the same passions, the same\n",
      "inclinations in the secrecies of their souls? What was the determining\n",
      "cause of their indisputable virtue? A happy marriage? Too many children?\n",
      "Timidity? Absence of temptation? Or were they merely orthodox through a\n",
      "more uneven balancing of their qualities, the animal in abeyance? For\n",
      "this very reason were they not frequently narrow, unsympathetic,\n",
      "unuseful--unless, indeed, they were of the few who, with the mighty\n",
      "temptations of the Victoria Gwynnes, were mightier still in their\n",
      "fidelity to some inner and cherished ideal. This lofty ideal of\n",
      "womanhood Isabel had unconsciously set up in her soul, and the sudden\n",
      "conviction of its imperfection was, after all, the reason of her sudden\n",
      "despair. For the soul with its immemorial and often incommunicable\n",
      "knowledge may have its moments of terror while the mind wonders.\n",
      "And she was disheartened at the sense of insignificance and\n",
      "mortification inspired by this contact with a side of life, as real and\n",
      "consequent as motherhood or government, instead of feeling merely\n",
      "repelled, infinitely superior in her unstained maidenhood. She had no\n",
      "wish to emulate, but neither did she relish feeling provincial, a chit,\n",
      "an outsider. Her youthful vanity had its way in a mind too speculative,\n",
      "intelligent, observant, merely to be shocked. Her memory reverted to\n",
      "experiences that had made her feel as much older than the ordinary girl\n",
      "as she now felt at sea. What was she, Isabel Otis, after all? She felt a\n",
      "mere assortment of fluids, which might or might not crystallize into\n",
      "some such being as she had dimly apprehended, or into something quite\n",
      "commonplace; realized with a shock that her own deep personal experience\n",
      "had left her less definitely moulded than she had imagined.\n",
      "She rose impatiently and bathed her eyes before ringing for the maid to\n",
      "lace her for dinner--it was long past tea-time. \"Perhaps I had better\n",
      "marry Lord Hexam and have ten children,\" she thought. \"That sort of\n",
      "existence has kept more women up to the correct standard than anything\n",
      "else except poverty.\"\n",
      "XIII\n",
      "\"And is this really your first big party?\" asked Hexam, wonderingly.\n",
      "\"The first! The first! And I am twenty-five! Just think of it! Of course\n",
      "I have been to students' balls, and little parties in Rosewater. But a\n",
      "function--never before.\"\n",
      "\"This is hardly a function--parties even in the big political\n",
      "country-houses are more or less informal.\"\n",
      "\"Informal! The jewels fairly blind my provincial eyes. And this is a\n",
      "real castle!\"\n",
      "\"Oh yes, it is a castle,\" he said, laughing outright. \"I suppose you\n",
      "have read up its record?\" he added, teasingly. \"You industrious and\n",
      "curious Americans know a lot more about us than we know about\n",
      "ourselves.\"\n",
      "\"Of course I know the history of this castle. I haven't the least doubt\n",
      "you know every word of it yourself. I have already learned that the\n",
      "English are not nearly so vacant-minded as, in their curious pride, they\n",
      "would have one believe.\"\n",
      "She threw back her head, half-closing her eyes in the ecstasy of her new\n",
      "experience. The dancing was in the picture-gallery, an immense room, in\n",
      "which there were many dark paintings of the old Italian and Spanish\n",
      "schools, besides the presentments of innumerable Arcots by the usual\n",
      "popular masters of the Dutch and English. The ceiling was of stone and\n",
      "vaulted, but set thick with electric lights, blazing down from their\n",
      "great height like the crystal stars of the tropics. It had seemed to\n",
      "Isabel that after entering the castle she had walked for ten minutes\n",
      "before reaching this room, where as brilliant a company was disporting\n",
      "itself as she was likely to look upon in England. The Duke of Arcot was\n",
      "an energetic Conservative and a member of the present cabinet, but his\n",
      "social attentions were ever directed to the prominent and interesting of\n",
      "whatever party or creed. As he found a particular zest in being\n",
      "surrounded by smart, bright and pretty women, the parties at the castle,\n",
      "and at Arcot House in London, were seldom surpassed in either brilliancy\n",
      "or interest. And as his rent-roll was abnormal, there was no sign of\n",
      "dilapidation within the gray walls and towers of the ancient castle, but\n",
      "much comfort and luxury against a background of countless treasures\n",
      "accumulated throughout the centuries. He had taken an immediate fancy to\n",
      "Isabel and promised to show her the lower rooms as soon as she tired of\n",
      "dancing.\n",
      "Hexam watched her with an amused indulgence that in no wise tempered his\n",
      "mounting admiration. She was radiant. Her blue eyes were shining and\n",
      "almost black, her cheeks flooded with a delicate pink. She wore a gown\n",
      "of white tulle upon whose floating surface were a few dark-blue lilies.\n",
      "The masses of her black hair were piled on her head in the fashion of\n",
      "her Californian grandmothers, and confined by a high Spanish comb of\n",
      "gold and tortoise-shell. Her only other jewel was a long string of Baja\n",
      "California pearls that had glistened on warm white necks in many an old\n",
      "California ballroom before ever an American had crossed the threshold of\n",
      "Arcot Castle. They had been given by Concha Argueello, when she assumed\n",
      "the gray habit of the Third Order of the Franciscan nuns, to the wife of\n",
      "her brother Santiago and so had come down to Isabel.\n",
      "And to-night this descendant of that powerful clan, unimaginable in her\n",
      "modern complexities to their simple minds, was receiving homage in the\n",
      "ballroom of one of the greatest houses in Europe. For there was no\n",
      "question, even in the minds of the young married women, who carry all\n",
      "before them in English society, that the American girl had created a\n",
      "furore among the men. Isabel had confided to the duke, who had lunched\n",
      "that day at Capheaton, and to Hexam, her haunting fear of being a\n",
      "wall-flower, and both had vowed that she should have no lack of partners\n",
      "at her first English ball. But to Hexam's disgust, at least, their\n",
      "solicitude came to an untimely end, and he was able to secure but two\n",
      "waltzes and a square dance. The duke had spoken for the cotillon, which\n",
      "he had no intention of dancing. He was a most estimable person, but he\n",
      "never ignored an opportunity to talk with a new and interesting woman.\n",
      "Isabel could hardly have failed to be a belle that night, for her spirit\n",
      "was pitched to a height of joy and triumph that charged her whole being\n",
      "with a powerful magnetism. Possibly with a presentiment that it was to\n",
      "be an isolated experience, she abandoned herself recklessly to the mere\n",
      "delight of living, her will imperious for the fulness of one of the\n",
      "dearest of girlhood's ideals. She was one of those women, cast, as she\n",
      "well knew, for tragic and dramatic contacts with life, but Nature in\n",
      "compensation had granted her a certain wildness of spirit that sprang\n",
      "spontaneously to meet the pleasure, trifling or great, of the mere\n",
      "present; no matter for how long a period, or how hard, its wings had\n",
      "been smitten.\n",
      "So she danced, and talked far more than was her wont, surpassing herself\n",
      "in every way, and no more interested in poor Hexam than in twenty\n",
      "others. He took her in to supper, however, and after three hours of\n",
      "dancing she was glad to rest and be sheltered by his determined bulk,\n",
      "planted squarely before her corner. She knew that she had a coronet very\n",
      "close to her footstool, and that this brilliant night might be but the\n",
      "prologue to a lifetime of the only society in the world worth while, but\n",
      "she was not conscious of any desire beyond the brimming cup of the\n",
      "moment. Moreover, she had never so thoroughly enjoyed being a girl, and\n",
      "love-making would have bored her grievously.\n",
      "The duke claimed her, and after a desultory tour of the great\n",
      "reception-rooms and an infinite number of little cabinets, containing\n",
      "some of the most valuable of the Japanese and Indian treasures, he led\n",
      "her to the library, a luxurious room conducive to rapid friendship.\n",
      "With that amiable desire, peculiar to the kindly Englishman, to gratify\n",
      "the ingenuous curiosity of the American, he produced a huge leather\n",
      "volume containing the various patents of nobility that marked the upward\n",
      "evolution of his house from a barony in some remote period of the\n",
      "world's history to the present dukedom, and the royal letters that had\n",
      "accompanied them. It was something he never would have dreamed of doing\n",
      "for a stranger of his own country, or of any state in Europe, but the\n",
      "English humor Americans that please them much as they would engaging\n",
      "children; and Isabel's eyes sparkled with so lively an intelligence that\n",
      "the duke fancied she had literary intentions and might one day find\n",
      "such information useful. He even showed her his complicated\n",
      "coat-of-arms, which included a bend sinister, for he had royal blood in\n",
      "his veins; and this slanting rod interested Isabel as deeply as the moat\n",
      "under the window. She was even more interested in the duke's attitude;\n",
      "it was evident that he felt no more vanity in his royal descent than\n",
      "deprecation of its irregular cause and enduring emblem. It was, and that\n",
      "was the end of it; but he had quite enough imagination to appreciate the\n",
      "effect of so picturesque an incident in family history upon the mind of\n",
      "the young republican.\n",
      "\"The best we can do is to descend irrelevantly from Washington,\n",
      "Hamilton, or Jefferson,\" said Isabel. \"Only we have not yet reached the\n",
      "stage where we dare to acknowledge it on our coat-of-arms. The illusions\n",
      "of the American youth must be preserved. Even the fact that one of our\n",
      "Presidents was a son of Aaron Burr is still to be read only in the great\n",
      "volume of unwritten history. My father was a sort of walking edition of\n",
      "that work.\"\n",
      "\"That is new to me!\" The duke was quite famous as a student of history,\n",
      "and took a personal interest in America, having been over twice in\n",
      "search of big game. He asked her many questions; but his interest in the\n",
      "general subject was as nothing to the enthusiasm she aroused by a chance\n",
      "allusion to the chicken-ranch. The duke was agricultural above all\n",
      "things; he had a model estate bristling with scientific improvement. He\n",
      "was enchanted at Isabel's picture of her wire-enclosed \"runs\" and yards\n",
      "containing industrious chickens of all ages, engaged, however\n",
      "innocently, in the pursuit of wealth. Isabel, when she chose, could\n",
      "invest any subject with glamour, and her account, delivered in tones\n",
      "notably accelerated, of the snow-white, red-crowned flocks, their\n",
      "aristocratic little white mansions, the luxurious nurseries for the\n",
      "\"chicks,\" and the astonishing and costly banquets with which they were\n",
      "daily regaled, was so lively that the duke vowed he would raise Leghorns\n",
      "forthwith. He asked her so many practical questions, taking copious\n",
      "notes, and inevitably embracing California ranch life in its entirety,\n",
      "in his thirst for knowledge, that Isabel had no more dancing that night;\n",
      "but she made an enduring impression upon the eminently practical mind of\n",
      "her host.\n",
      "It was quite two hours after supper, and Isabel was beginning to reflect\n",
      "with some humor upon the brevity of all illusions, when Hexam and Miss\n",
      "Thangue appeared simultaneously and announced that the Capheaton guests\n",
      "were leaving. Hexam looked sulky and suspicious. Flora was smiling.\n",
      "\"For the first time--\" she murmured.\n",
      "Isabel and the duke laughed outright, and then shook hands warmly.\n",
      "\"When I go home we can correspond,\" she said to him, \"and I will tell\n",
      "you all the new kinks. We are always improving.\"\n",
      "\"The duke looked positively rejuvenated,\" said Hexam, spitefully, as\n",
      "they walked down the corridor. \"Have you discovered the elixir of life\n",
      "in California, and promised him the prescription.\"\n",
      "\"No,\" said Isabel, demurely. \"I have merely been initiating him into the\n",
      "mysteries of raising Leghorns.\"\n",
      "Hexam looked stupefied, but Miss Thangue burst into a merry peal of\n",
      "laughter.\n",
      "\"Isabel!\" she exclaimed. \"I begin to suspect you are a minx!\"\n",
      "And Isabel laughed, too, in sheer excess of animal spirits and gratified\n",
      "vanity. She had excellent cause to remember the ebullition, for it was\n",
      "some time before she laughed again.\n",
      "The duchess, with her light sweet smile, her old-fashioned\n",
      "Book-of-Beauty style, a certain affectation of shabbiness in her\n",
      "black-and-silver gown, looked a more indispensable part of the picture\n",
      "than any of her guests, as she stood in the middle of the great\n",
      "drawing-room with a group of her more intimate friends. Among them was\n",
      "Lady Victoria, more normal of mood this evening, sufficiently gracious,\n",
      "superbly indifferent, although she had held her court as usual.\n",
      "She tapped Isabel lightly on the cheek with her fan. \"You were quite the\n",
      "rage,\" she said. \"I never should have forgiven you if you had not been.\"\n",
      "And Isabel had not the slightest doubt of her sincerity.\n",
      "The duchess, in the immensity of her castle, did not pretend to keep an\n",
      "eye on any one, and would have been the last to suspect that Miss Otis\n",
      "had inspired her husband with a sudden passion for chickens. She shook\n",
      "hands approvingly with the young American and asked her to come over\n",
      "informally to luncheon on the morrow.\n",
      "\"Is your head turning?\" asked Miss Thangue, as they drove home. \"You\n",
      "must reap the results of your success; it would be a pity not to. After\n",
      "a few weeks here with Vicky you must go on a round of visits and then\n",
      "have a season in London.\"\n",
      "\"It would be glorious!\" exclaimed Isabel, in whom problems were\n",
      "moribund. \"I certainly believe I shall.\"\n",
      "She was in the second of the carriages to reach Capheaton, and Gwynne,\n",
      "who was still standing on the steps, helped her down, and asked her\n",
      "pleasantly if she had enjoyed herself.\n",
      "\"I had such a good time I know I sha'n't sleep a wink for twenty-four\n",
      "hours. I believe I'll go to the library and get a book of yours I began\n",
      "on Sunday--only--\" She hesitated. A talk with this enigmatical cousin\n",
      "would be a proper climax to the triumphs of the night. She raised her\n",
      "eyes, full of flattering appeal. \"There are one or two points I did not\n",
      "quite understand--I have hesitated to go on--\"\n",
      "He too was wakeful, and rose to the bait promptly. \"Suppose you give me\n",

      "with their caballeros flinging gold and silver at their feet, Nina\n",
      "Randolph and Chonita Hathaway and Helena Belmont, with their pugnacious\n",
      "\"courts,\" had ever felt as exultant as she. That last moment, as she\n",
      "stepped lightly over the threshold of the library, was a sort of climax\n",
      "to the intoxication of youth.\n",
      "And then she stopped short, stifling a cry of terror. The library,\n",
      "except for the wandering moonshine, was unlit, but a ray fell directly\n",
      "across a shadowy figure in the depths of a chair, half-way down the\n",
      "room. It was a relaxed figure, the head fallen on the chest; the arms\n",
      "were hanging limply over the sides of the chair, the hands ghastly in\n",
      "the moonlight. At the rustle of skirts the figure slowly raised its\n",
      "head, and the eyes of a man, haunted rather than haunting, looked out of\n",
      "a drawn and livid face. But the movement was not followed by speech, and\n",
      "Isabel stood, stiff with horror, convinced that she was in the presence\n",
      "of the Capheaton ghost. Of course, like all old manor-houses, it had\n",
      "one, and she was too imaginative not to accept with her nerves if not\n",
      "with her intelligence this ugly proof of a restless domain beyond the\n",
      "grave. But her petrifaction was mercifully brief. There was a quick step\n",
      "behind her, and then an exclamation of horror as Gwynne shot past and\n",
      "caught the lugubrious visitant by the shoulder.\n",
      "\"Good God, Zeal!\" he cried, and his voice shook. \"What is it, old man?\n",
      "You look--you look--\"\n",
      "The man in the chair rose slowly and drew a long breath, which seemed to\n",
      "infuse him with life again.\n",
      "\"I probably look much as I feel,\" he said, grimly. \"I'm about to go on a\n",
      "journey, and if you can give me a few minutes--\"\n",

      "That night had also been one of triumph for Elton Gwynne. He had dined\n",
      "at the castle, and--his Julia having flitted to another\n",
      "country-house--spent the greater part of the evening in the smoking-room\n",
      "with half a score of the most eminent men in political England; and\n",
      "others whose recognition was not to be despised.\n",
      "As there were many guests at the castle the dinner took place in the\n",
      "banquet-hall, but at six or eight round tables, and Gwynne had found\n",
      "himself distinguished above all the other young men present by being\n",
      "seated at that of the duchess. The prime-minister, the chancellor of the\n",
      "exchequer, two other members of the cabinet, and an ambassador were his\n",
      "companions. All the women were of exalted station, but for this fact\n",
      "Gwynne cared nothing, being entirely free of that snobbery which so\n",
      "often agitates even the best-born of the world; indeed, would have been\n",
      "resentful of the ripe age of the ladies--accumulated with their\n",
      "political values--had it not been for the tremendous compliment paid to\n",
      "his personal achievement.\n",
      "He could not sit beside her grace in that nest of titles, but at the\n",
      "suggestion of the duke he had been placed as nearly opposite her as the\n",
      "round table permitted, and he soon forgot the broken circle of\n",
      "immemorial bosoms in the manifest disapproval of the Conservative\n",
      "premier towards himself, and in the attitude of the other men, which,\n",
      "whether hostile or friendly, evinced a recognition of the rising star\n",
      "and a tolerance of his ideas.\n",
      "There is always a glamour about a very young man who has given\n",
      "cumulative evidence of genius and compelled the attention of the world,\n",
      "always distrustful of youth. His enemies had long since--and he was but\n",
      "thirty--admitted his gift for letters, fiercely as they might scoff at\n",
      "his conclusions; and his rewards for bravery in the field had aroused no\n",
      "adverse comment. But while his most persistent critics had never\n",
      "discovered him truthless and corruptible, his political sincerity had\n",
      "been called into question even by his colleagues, and almost unanimously\n",
      "by the opposition. His principles were by no means so rigidly outlined\n",
      "as those of the great Whig families, nor of the men who belonged to the\n",
      "Liberal party as a natural result of their more modest station and\n",
      "protesting spirit. He was strong on the fundamental principles of the\n",
      "party, and far more energetic in his advocacy of the rights and needs of\n",
      "the working-man than any Liberal of his own class, but he rarely, if\n",
      "ever, alluded to the question of Home Rule; a question somnolent but by\n",
      "no means dead; and the omission savored of Unionism, in spite of his\n",
      "avowed scorn of all compromises.\n",
      "These facts, taken in connection with the pride and arrogance of the\n",
      "young scion of the house of Strathland and Zeal, generated the suspicion\n",
      "that he had allied himself with the Liberal party for two reasons only:\n",
      "its weakness in first-class men, and his passion for self-advertising.\n",
      "No one disputed his pre-eminence in this branch of industrial art, for\n",
      "although he never descended to commonplace methods, and the interviewer,\n",
      "far from being sought, rather dreaded him than otherwise, there was no\n",
      "man in England who was such a mine for \"copy,\" nor of a perennially\n",
      "greener growth in the select front lawn of \"news.\" When he attacked the\n",
      "government he was eminently quotable, and this endeared him to both\n",
      "reporters and editors. When he was interviewed, fearsome in manner as he\n",
      "was, he sent the worm away packed with ideas and phrases. But although\n",
      "he was almost continuously on the tongue, and the object of more\n",
      "acrimonious discussion than any young man in England, distrust of him\n",
      "had grown to such proportions that he had been dropped after one brief\n",
      "sojourn in the House; and to regain his seat had taken two years of the\n",
      "hardest and most brilliant fighting Great Britain had seen since the\n",
      "Conservative majority of 1874 permitted Disraeli to rest on his prickly\n",
      "laurels. But this memorable battle of one young man against a mighty\n",
      "phalanx of enemies and doubting friends had battered down the prejudices\n",
      "of his own party, and won a meed of applause from even those of stout\n",
      "old Tory principles. The humbler class, upon whom the election largely\n",
      "depended, were captivated by his eloquence, his insidious manipulation\n",
      "of the best in their natures, filling them with a judicious mixture of\n",
      "ideals and self-approval; while the phenomenon he invariably presented\n",
      "on the platform of the gradual awakening into life of a warm-blooded\n",
      "generous magnetic and earnest inner man, so effectually concealed at\n",
      "other times within a repellent exterior, never failed to induce in them\n",
      "the belief that something responsive in their own personalities awakened\n",
      "that rare spirit from its stifled sleep. That the glamour of his birth\n",
      "and condescension to their plane had aught to do with the dazzling\n",
      "quality of his charm, they might have admitted had their minds been\n",
      "driven by the enemy into the regions of self-analysis, but in any case\n",
      "he was the theme of two-thirds of the \"pubs\" and reading-rooms in\n",
      "England. He had achieved a sweeping victory that loomed portentously as\n",
      "a forerunner of greater triumphs in the future; for the personal\n",
      "popularity he had achieved, the gift for leadership he had demonstrated,\n",
      "the self-control he showed at all times, and the fatally adhesive\n",
      "quality of his biting wit, had strengthened the Liberal party and caused\n",
      "the Conservative to wish that he had never been born.\n",
      "And flushed with self-love and the conquest of the woman of his desire,\n",
      "he had never talked better than on that night at Arcot; nor less\n",
      "offensively, for his arrogance and assertiveness were tempered by the\n",
      "warm high tide of his emotions. It was a magnificent room, the\n",
      "banquet-hall at Arcot, as large as that of many royal palaces, hung with\n",
      "old Gobelins and frescoed by a pupil of Giotto. It was a fit setting for\n",
      "the triumphant hour of the \"most remarkable young man since the younger\n",
      "Pitt,\" a phrase which, if not notably suave, at least possessed an\n",
      "astonishing vigor, and was almost as familiar in American and\n",
      "continental newspapers as in his own proud nation; a nation always so\n",
      "keen to possess the first in all departments of excellence--creating\n",
      "them out of second-class material when the first is lacking--that the\n",
      "wonder was she had been so long accepting Elton Gwynne. Nothing,\n",
      "perhaps, but a noble desire for a really great man restrained her.\n",
      "Opposite Gwynne, the duchess, sweet and tactful, if little more than an\n",
      "ornamental husk in which the juices of her race possibly recuperated to\n",
      "invigorate the future generations, was as fair and stately as her castle\n",
      "demanded; and if her gown was shabby her jewels were not. On either\n",

      "the most politically important; all, without exception, of an inherited\n",
      "status that brought them once a year as a matter of course within the\n",
      "sternly guarded portals of Arcot. Gwynne did not know that Mrs. Kaye had\n",
      "knocked at these sacred portals in vain; for such gossip, if by chance\n",
      "he heard it, made no impression upon him whatever. But he was by no\n",
      "means insensible to the salient fact that he was one among the chosen of\n",
      "Earth to-night, and that it was good to be the hero of such an assembly.\n",
      "For that he was the hero there was no manner of doubt, and when the\n",
      "dinner was over he spent but half an hour in the drawing-room,\n",
      "preferring the conversation of the heads of state, who so seldom\n",
      "gratified the vanity of a man of his years, but whom he had the power to\n",
      "interest whether they approved of him or not. He had many friends among\n",
      "women, some conquered by the magic of notoriety, others, like Flora\n",
      "Thangue, sensible of his finer side, or tolerant of him through\n",
      "life-long intimacy; and there were times when he was as alive to the\n",
      "pleasures of their society as any young sprig about town; but to-night\n",
      "their admiration was too illogical to administer to the self-love which\n",
      "in the last few days had palpitated with so exquisite a sense of\n",
      "fruition. Moreover, it gave him the keenest satisfaction to read in the\n",
      "manner of these older and long-tried men the grudging belief in his own\n",
      "sincerity.\n",
      "In reality his motives for joining a party at war with every tradition\n",

      "more of an aristocrat than many of his class, with whom a simpler\n",
      "attitude had become the fashion, even if it were not marrow-deep. But\n",
      "the ruling motive had been his passionate love of battle, a trait\n",
      "inherited perhaps from his pioneer ancestors, whose roots were in the\n",
      "soil. This desire to prove his mettle and fill his life with the only\n",
      "excitement worthy of his gifts, would alone have made him turn from the\n",

      "the half of a century.\n",

      "that he beheld a rival as vigorous and dangerous as of old--I had gained\n",
      "ten pounds and was looking and feeling particularly fit. At all events\n",
      "the mess affected me as alcohol never had done in even my salet days,\n",

      "Brathland had once been heard to say that he wished we were both\n",
      "cow-boys on an American ranch so that he could put a bullet into me\n",
      "without taking the consequences--he never had a brain above shilling\n",

      "himself by the chimney-piece. The rest were lying about in long chairs,\n",
      "smoking, and drinking whiskey-and-sodas. They were all sober enough, and\n",
      "Brathland looked the more of a beast by contrast.\n",
      "\"I took a chair opposite him and ordered my thoughts to arrange\n",
      "themselves in phrases that should pierce his mental hide and wither the\n",

      "him. The men fairly bounded out of their chairs. There were two waiters\n",
      "in the room--just come in with Apollinaris. Raglin slammed the doors to,\n",
      "and, while Ormond and Hethrington laid Brathland out on a sofa, asked\n",
      "the servants if they would hold their tongues until it was known whether\n",
      "he would die or not. They assented readily enough, knowing how damned\n",

      "that he could trust.\n",
      "\"We all regathered in the smoking-room, shut the waiters in the\n",

      "hideously sober than I ever had been in my life. What they thought of me\n",
      "I neither knew nor cared, and it is doubtful if they knew themselves;\n",
      "their one thought was to keep the matter from getting out and dragging\n",
      "the Club into a scandal; and of course Raglin was equally keen on\n",
      "sheltering the family, whether Brathland lived or died. Anyhow, I fancy\n",

      "offered them four hundred each for their silence, or in the case of\n",
      "Brathland's death--the surgeon held out hopes--a thousand. They coolly\n",
      "replied they would take a thousand apiece before noon on the following\n",

      "one or two others--jawed for an hour; but the wretches never yielded an\n",
      "inch. They had us on the hip and were not likely to be put off by any\n",
      "amount of eloquence. Of course we caved in and God knows what amount of\n",
      "future blackmail the Club is in for. Then there was the thousand for the\n",
      "surgeon, and the nurse would expect a thousand more. Of course I made\n",
      "myself responsible for the entire amount. Raglin insisted for a time\n",
      "upon going halves--blood may be blood, but he had despised Bratty as\n",
      "much as I ever did--but of course I would not hear of it.\n",
      "\"The next afternoon the surgeon probed again, and Brathland died under\n",
      "the ether. The wound after probing looked sufficiently like an ordinary\n",
      "incision to deceive any one. Raglin and Harold Lorcutt--who, of course,\n",
      "was told the truth--naturally had the body sealed up in lead before\n",
      "taking it north. The old duke and the women of the family are in a fair\n",

      "But Gwynne made no reply. His mind, released, was working abnormally,\n",
      "and his face was as livid as his cousin's had been.\n",

      "exhaustion, the confession shaken the rigidity from his mind. He planted\n",
      "himself on the hearth-rug with an air that approached nonchalance. His\n",
      "thin clever face had a burning spot on either cheek, his sunken eyes\n",
      "were no longer haunted, but brilliant and staring; his thin high nose\n",
      "and fine hands twitched slightly, as if his nerves were enjoying a too\n",
      "sudden release.\n",

      "without the consent of my will--\n",

      "what I paid out to-day. There isn't a penny for the girls. They will be\n",
      "dependent on Strathland--as I should be if I lived; a position for which\n",
      "I have as little relish as for that of a murderer on the loose. And\n",
      "should I ever be really safe? If this stinking quartet takes it into its\n",
      "head to levy annual blackmail, where is the money coming from? I won't\n",

      "of dangling from the end of a rope; or, if the judge was inclined to\n",
      "have pity on the family, of dying in a prison hospital. Even if I\n",
      "trumped up the necessary fortitude I should be a blacker villain than I\n",

      "more coolly and carefully than had hitherto been possible; begged him to\n",

      "several failures accomplished the feat. He was willing to believe that\n",
      "his first impulse would have been to destroy himself, not so much\n",
      "through fear as through a blind sense of atonement, for when he\n",
      "endeavored to argue that the crime belonged to the law and the public,\n",

      "deliberate might damn a man's soul, no doubt he deserved nothing less,\n",

      "as yet, but with too many outcroppings to have been overlooked. But the\n",
      "very strength it gave him served to confuse the simplicity of the\n",
      "religious instinct; and duty, like the code of honor, endures many\n",

      "Nevertheless, he hastened to his grandfather, for he knew how little the\n",

      "reasonably sure that if Zeal lived until the following morning it would\n",
      "be some time before he brought himself to the sticking-point again. He\n",
      "announced to his mother and his guests that it was his duty to spend\n",
      "twenty-four hours with his grandfather, promising to return in time for\n",
      "two hours' shooting on the morrow.\n",

      "\"Zeal arrived on the train before yours--went straight to his room,\n",

      "\"I was afraid he might be ill,\" he replied, coolly. \"But doubtless he\n",

      "close to the family vault as possible.\n",
      "No meal had ever seemed as long as that last luncheon with his\n",
      "grandfather, who promptly dismissed the subject of his detested heir and\n",

      "collectedly as if he had not been possessed with the sickening idea that\n",
      "the very bones had gone out of him. When luncheon was over he\n",
      "accompanied his grandfather to the library, then after smoking a third\n",
      "of a cigar, left him to his nap, frankly stating that he thought he had\n",
      "better look up Zeal, who had been rather seedy of late; he would risk\n",
      "being unwelcome.\n",
      "He walked slowly up the stair and along the corridor to his cousin's\n",
      "suite; he was in no hurry to reach it, but neither could he wait for the\n",
      "possible discovery of the servants at the dinner-hour.\n",
      "He knocked at the door of the sitting-room. There was no answer. He\n",
      "turned the handle. The door was locked. Then he pounded and called. He\n",
      "was about to fling himself against the door when he heard a quick step\n",
      "in the corridor, and before he could retreat Lord Strathland was beside\n",
      "him. There was no defect in the old gentleman's eyesight nor in his\n",
      "perceptions. Zeal's abrupt arrival without servant or luggage, and his\n",
      "more than usual rudeness, had charged him with vague suspicions as well\n",
      "as annoyance. When Gwynne, in spite of his self-control, had turned\n",
      "livid upon hearing that Zeal was in the Abbey, and had risen as if to\n",
      "fly to his rescue, a dark if undefined foreboding had entered his\n",
      "grandfather's mind. But Lord Strathland respected the reserve of his\n",
      "guests, no matter how nearly related, and, dismissing the subject, had\n",
      "forgotten his apprehension until Gwynne revived it by his untimely\n",
      "pilgrimage. Then Lord Strathland thought the time had come to hear the\n",
      "truth.\n",
      "\"Well?\" he demanded, sharply. \"What is it? What's up? Why doesn't Zeal\n",
      "open? I saw him in Piccadilly on Saturday and he stared at me as if he\n",
      "had never seen me before. I thought at the moment it was some of his\n",
      "damned impertinence, but concluded that he had something on his mind. He\n",
      "looked more dead than alive.\"\n",
      "Gwynne's back was to the light, and he controlled his voice, although\n",
      "his heart was thumping. \"Well, he has been, poor chap--awfully seedy--I\n",
      "am really worried. He may have anticipated a final hemorrhage, and\n",
      "crawled home to die.\" He cherished the hope that Zeal had been at pains\n",
      "to procure an untraceable drug.\n",
      "\"Ah! Well--I hope that is it if the poor fellow is dead. He looked as if\n",

      "no doubt he went to pieces over some wretched woman again. Come, let us\n",

      "They threw themselves against the door. The old gentleman was heavy and\n",
      "Gwynne sound and wiry in spite of his delicate appearance. The door was\n",
      "stout but its hinges were old, and after several attempts they drove it\n",
      "in. Lord Strathland's face was pale and he was panting, but he led the\n",
      "way rapidly through the sitting-room into the bedroom.\n",
      "Zeal had undressed, extended himself on the bed, and covered his body\n",
      "with an eider-down quilt. Lord Strathland jerked it off, and both saw\n",
      "what they had expected to see, for a faint odor of burnt powder lingered\n",
      "in the rooms.\n",
      "Lord Strathland's face was ghastly, almost blue. He had anticipated\n",
      "death, not with the imagination of the young, but dully, through the\n",
      "atrophied faculties of his age, and the shock could hardly have been\n",
      "greater had he found his grandson without warning.\n",
      "\"What does this mean?\" he demanded, thickly. \"You know and I will know.\"\n",
      "Gwynne took him firmly by the arm and turned him about. \"Not here,\" he\n",
      "said. \"Come to the library. I will tell you, but I am no more fit to\n",
      "talk just now than you are to listen.\"\n",
      "His grandfather submitted, and Gwynne dropped his arm and rearranged the\n",
      "quilt over his cousin's body. At the same moment Lord Strathland's eyes\n",
      "lit on a sealed letter addressed to himself. Before Gwynne could\n",
      "interfere he had broken the seal. It ran:\n",
      "MY LORD,--I murdered Brathland. In cold blood--saving the fact\n",
      "that I was drunk. My entire private fortune has gone for purposes\n",
      "of blackmail. Even that might not have saved me eventually from the\n",

      "further particulars, should you care to listen to them. ZEAL.\"\n",
      "He too had known nothing of the condition of his grandfather's heart,\n",
      "and it had amused him to plan a last shock to the perennial optimism\n",
      "and complacency of the person he disliked most on earth. The smile was\n",
      "still on his frozen lips that expressed the amused anticipation of his\n",
      "brain. Death, to do him justice, he had met with none of the cowardice\n",
      "he had vaunted, and consistently with his arid cynical soul.\n",
      "\"Don't read it! Don't!\" Gwynne had exclaimed, in agony, and forgetting\n",
      "the awful figure on the bed in his alarm at the sight of his\n",
      "grandfather's face. \"If you must know the truth let me tell it in my own\n",
      "way.\"\n",

      "clothes.\n",
      "XVII\n",
      "Gwynne wondered if he should ever shake off the pall-like memories of\n",
      "the past week: the testimony before the coroner, in which every word had\n",
      "to be weighed as carefully as if life instead of the honor of the\n",
      "worthless dead were at stake, the reporters from the less dignified of\n",
      "the British newspapers, and the American correspondents, two of whom\n",
      "dodged the vigilance of the servants, entered the Abbey by a window, and\n",
      "took snap shots of the lower rooms and of the coffins in the\n",
      "death-chamber; the painful scenes with the women of the family, who had\n",
      "descended in a body; the wearisome interview with the family solicitor,\n",
      "in the course of which he had learned that he was heir to little more\n",
      "than the entailed properties; which must be let in order to insure an\n",
      "income for his three unmarried aunts, Zeal's five girls, and himself;\n",
      "the hideous reiteration of \"your lordship\" by the obsequious servants,\n",
      "that reproduced in his mind the slow deep notes of the passing bell,\n",
      "tolled in the village for his grandfather and cousin.\n",
      "A letter from Julia Kaye had fluttered in like a dove of promise, but he\n",
      "had never been able to recall anything in the six pages of graceful\n",
      "sympathy but her allusions to the dead as \"the marquess\" and \"the earl.\"\n",
      "He told himself angrily that his brain must have weakened to notice a\n",
      "solecism at such a time, but it is in moments of abnormal mental strain\n",
      "that trifles have their innings; and during the beautiful service in the\n",
      "chapel he caught himself wondering if any woman of his own class could\n",
      "have made such a slip. Always deaf to gossip, he had no suspicion that\n",
      "his Julia had been laughed at more than once for her inability to grasp\n",
      "all the unwritten laws of a world which she had entered too late. With\n",
      "an ear in which a title lingered like a full voluptuous note of music,\n",
      "she was blunt to certain of the democratic canons of modern society.\n",
      "Although it gave her the keenest pleasure to address the highest\n",
      "bulwarks of the peerage off-handedly as \"duke\" and \"duchess,\" there had\n",
      "been moments of confusion when she had lapsed naturally into \"your\n",
      "grace.\" And it would have seemed like a lost opportunity to have alluded\n",
      "to a titled foreigner without his \"von\" or \"de,\" even where there was a\n",
      "more positive title to use as often as she pleased. It was the one weak\n",
      "spot in a singularly acute and accomplished mind.\n",
      "But of all this Gwynne knew nothing, and he was dully wondering if a\n",
      "great love could be affected by trifles, and if his brain and character\n",
      "were of less immutable material than he had believed, his mental vision\n",
      "still straying through the insupportable gloom of the past week, when he\n",
      "heard a light foot-fall beyond the door. He sprang to his feet, cursing\n",
      "his nerves, and was by no means reassured upon seeing the long figure of\n",
      "a woman, dressed entirely in white, a candle in her hand, approaching\n",
      "him down the dark corridor. He had never given a moment's thought in his\n",
      "active life to psychic phenomena, but he was in a state of mind where\n",
      "nothing would have surprised him, and he had turned cold to his\n",
      "finger-tips when a familiar voice reassured him.\n",
      "\"I am not Lady Macbeth,\" said Isabel, with a tremor in her own voice, as\n",
      "she entered and blew out the candle. \"But I felt like her as I braved\n",
      "the terrors of all those dark corridors and that staircase in my wild\n",
      "desire to talk to a living person. I had arrived at that stage where all\n",
      "your ancestors gibbered at the foot of my bed. Flora has been sleeping\n",
      "with me, but your mother wanted her to-night, and I am deserted.\"\n",
      "\"What a lot of babies you are!\" Gwynne was delighted to wreak his\n",
      "self-contempt on some one else, but glad of the interruption, and\n",
      "unexpectedly mellowed by the sight of a pretty woman after the red noses\n",
      "and sable plumage of the past week. It was true that he had seen Isabel\n",
      "at dinner, but like Flora she had worn a black gown out of respect to\n",
      "the family woe, and he hated the sight of black.\n",
      "Now she wore a gown of soft white wool fastened at the throat and waist\n",
      "with a blue ribbon; and even her profile, whose severity he had\n",
      "disapproved, having a masculine weakness for pugs, was softened by the\n",
      "absence of the coils or braids that commonly framed it: her hair hung in\n",
      "one tremendous plait to the heels of her slippers.\n",
      "\"I see that you have no more sleep in you than I have,\" he said. \"Let us\n",
      "make a night of it.\"\n",
      "It had rained all day and he was suddenly alive to a sense of physical\n",
      "discomfort. He rang and ordered a servant to make a fire and bring the\n",
      "tea-service.\n",
      "\"How did you know I was here?\" he asked Isabel, when they were alone\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\"I felt that you were, but I went first to your room and tapped. I was\n",
      "quite capable of waking you up. Thank heaven I summoned the courage to\n",
      "come down. This is delightful.\"\n",
      "The fire was crackling in the grate, the water boiling in the big silver\n",
      "kettle. Isabel made his tea almost black, but diluted her own, lest she\n",
      "should be left alone before she too was ready for sleep.\n",
      "\"You have had a beastly time these last days,\" he said, for he was\n",
      "genuinely hospitable. \"I am sorry you did not happen to come a month\n",
      "earlier. Have you seen anything of Hexam? He was going on to Arcot.\"\n",
      "\"He rode over, or walked over, every day. We should have fallen a prey\n",
      "to melancholy without him, although you may believe me when I assure you\n",
      "that we thought more of you than we did of ourselves. I am your own\n",
      "blood-relation, so I have a right to feel dreadfully sympathetic--may I\n",
      "have a cigarette?\"\n",
      "\"What a brick you are to smoke! I don't mind being sympathized with for\n",
      "a change. I have had to do so much sympathizing with others in the last\n",
      "week that I have not had time to pity myself. Even my mother went to\n",
      "pieces, for she was fond of Zeal, poor old chap, and her conscience\n",
      "scorched her because she was always rather nasty to my grandfather--she\n",
      "likes and dislikes tremendously, you know; although to most people she\n",
      "is merely indifferent. But when she dislikes--\" He blew the ashes from\n",
      "the tip of his cigarette with a slight whistling sound.\n",
      "Flora Thangue had extracted all the particulars of the death and suicide\n",
      "from Lady Victoria--who knew nothing, however, of the tragic cause of\n",
      "both--and imparted them to Isabel, whose mind, in consequence, was free\n",
      "of morbid curiosity. She had also read the newspapers. The speculations\n",
      "and veiled hints of the sensational sheets had not interested her, but\n",
      "she had pondered deeply over leaders in the more dignified organs, which\n",
      "had abounded in comment upon the changed conditions in the meteoric\n",
      "career of the young man who was no longer Elton Gwynne, but a peer of\n",
      "the realm.\n",
      "\"Do you mind it so awfully much?\" she asked, after a short silence\n",
      "during which they had both smoked absently and gazed at the fire.\n",
      "\"What?\" Gwynne turned the cold surprise of his eyes upon her. \"Losing\n",
      "two of the four people I cared most for on earth?\"\n",
      "\"Of course not. Being suddenly made a peer and having to begin all over.\n",
      "You never will be called Elton Gwynne again, and you will have as much\n",
      "trouble educating the public up to your new name as if you were emerging\n",
      "from obscurity for the first time.\"\n",
      "The words, brutally direct, rolled away the last clouds of his lethargy.\n",
      "He vividly realized that he had been skulking before the closed shutters\n",
      "of his understanding, accepting the new conditions with but the dulled\n",
      "surface of his brain.\n",
      "Now his naked soul stared at her out of his white face and tortured\n",
      "eyes, and she looked away. She had not believed that he could be racked\n",
      "with feeling of any sort, and it was as if she heard him cry: \"Oh, God!\n",
      "Oh, God!\" although his lips were silent.\n",
      "But she did not change the subject.\n",
      "\"I suppose you haven't seen the newspapers,\" she said. \"I cut out all\n",
      "the editorials and paragraphs I thought would interest you. One of the\n",
      "big dailies, I forget which, said that the interruption of your career\n",
      "was a greater political tragedy than Parnell's or Lord Randolph\n",
      "Churchill's.\"\n",
      "\"Do they say that?\" asked Gwynne, eagerly. \"Well, God knows, it is a\n",
      "tragedy for me.\"\n",
      "\"Don't you like being a peer the least little bit? I am too feminine,\n",
      "possibly too American, not to see a certain picturesqueness in a title,\n",
      "especially in such a pretty one as yours; and there is no doubt that you\n",
      "are a more imposing figure in the eyes of the world to-day than you were\n",
      "a week ago. Are you really indifferent to that side of it?\"\n",
      "\"Am I? One does such a lot of self-posing and self-imposition. There are\n",
      "few things in this world that gratify a man's vanity more than being a\n",
      "peer of Great Britain, and, no doubt, had I happened to be born without\n",
      "what you might call a fighting ambition, and certain abilities, I\n",
      "should--barring natural grief--feel that I was one of the favorites of\n",
      "destiny--that is to say if I had a commensurate income. The fact that I\n",
      "must let the Abbey and Capheaton, and after portioning off all the\n",
      "unmarried women of the family, shall have barely enough left to keep up\n",
      "my flat in Charles Street, may have something to do with my absence of\n",
      "enthusiasm. But--yes--I _am_ sure of myself!\" he burst out. \"I am the\n",
      "most miserable man on earth to-night, and the reason is not that I have\n",
      "lost two good friends, but because my career is ruined, broken off in\n",
      "the middle.\"\n",
      "\"You could become a militant Liberal peer.\"\n",
      "\"Paradoxes don't happen to appeal to me. And the only chance for a\n",
      "genuine fighter is the House of Commons. Besides, it is impossible for a\n",
      "man to be a peer and remain a true Liberal. Power, and inherited\n",
      "influence, and exalted social position have a deadly insinuation. I\n",
      "don't believe any man is strong enough to withstand them. There is never\n",
      "an hour that a peer is not reminded of his difference from the mass of\n",
      "humanity; and human nature is too weak to resist complacency in the\n",
      "end--long before the end. And complacency is the premature old age of\n",
      "the brain and character. If this tragedy had not occurred, even if my\n",
      "grandfather had lived on for fifteen years more, as there was every\n",
      "reason to believe he would, I might have gone on that much longer before\n",
      "discovering weak points in my character. Now God knows what I shall\n",
      "develop.\"\n",
      "\"Have you made any plans?\"\n",
      "\"Plans? I hadn't faced the situation until you spoke.\"\n",
      "\"You have weak spots like other people, of course. You would be a horrid\n",
      "prig if you hadn't. But you surely must know if your Liberalism is\n",
      "sincere, ingrained. There is no question that you are a hopeless\n",
      "aristocrat in essentials. But so have been certain of America's greatest\n",
      "patriots--Washington and Hamilton, for instance. I do not see that it\n",
      "matters. One can hold to what seems to me the first principles of\n",
      "advanced civilization--that hereditary monarchy is an insult to\n",
      "self-respecting and enlightened men--without wishing to associate with\n",
      "those that offend grammar and good taste. Education, intellect,\n",
      "breeding, would create an aristocracy among anarchists on a desert\n",
      "island--supposing any possessed them; and in time it would become as\n",
      "intolerant of liberties as if it harked back to the battle of Hastings.\n",
      "There is no plant that grows so rapidly in the human garden as\n",
      "self-superiority, and it is ridiculous only when watered by nothing more\n",
      "excusable than the arbitrary social conditions that exist in the United\n",

      "and logical forms. \"Whatever may have been the various motives that\n",
      "impelled me into the Liberal party in the beginning, there is no\n",
      "question that I have become even more extreme and single-minded than I\n",
      "have let the world know. Perhaps it is my American blood, although I\n",
      "never thought of that before. At all events, had the time been ripe I\n",
      "should have devoted all the gift for leadership I now possess, and all\n",
      "the power I could build up, to overturning monarchy in this country and\n",
      "establishing a republic. There! I never confessed as much to a living\n",

      "\"With yourself as President?\"\n",
      "\"Sooner or later--the sooner the better. But I waste no time in dreams,\n",

      "enough that I had a great and useful career before me and might have\n",

      "\"Well, that is over,\" said Isabel, conclusively. \"There is only one\n",
      "thing left you and that is to come over and be an American.\"\n",

      "\"You will have all the fighting you want over there. You will have to\n",

      "it is to stand and fight absolutely alone--for if they learn of your\n",
      "exalted birth they will but distrust you the more; and you will taste\n",
      "the sweets of real success for the first time in your life. In spite of\n",
      "your youth and enthusiasm, there is in you a vein of inevitable\n",
      "cynicism, for you have had far too much experience of the flatterer and\n",

      "John Smith there would have been no editorial comments of any sort upon\n",
      "the tragic end of your relatives, and the great world would have taken\n",
      "as little notice of your abilities until you had compelled its unwilling\n",
      "attention by many more years of hard work. America will take you for\n",
      "exactly what you are and no more. But you will have to become more\n",
      "American than the Americans; although you may continue to say 'ain't it'\n",
      "and 'it's me' and drop your final gs, because those are all the\n",
      "hall-marks of the half-educated in the United States, and will rather\n",

      "solecisms of a gentleman whose education had begun in a Lancashire alley\n",
      "and finished in the business purlieus of Chicago, who had acquired the\n",
      "American vice of brag in its acutest form, and who, when in his cups,\n",
      "shouted and spat and swore, were more than the most enterprising among\n",
      "them had been called upon to endure. The social ambitions of the\n",

      "Brighton, where, in the course of time, she toned him down. They made\n",
      "their way slowly into society of a sort, and attracted the attention of\n",
      "the public. There was no law to prevent them from dining at the\n",
      "fashionable hotels, where Paris gowns could not pass unobserved; and\n",
      "their turnouts were irreproachable.\n",
      "Mrs. Tippet, an astute woman, by this time had realized that hers was\n",
      "not the destiny of the social star, and she concentrated her hopes and\n",
      "ambitions upon her one child, an uncommonly clever little girl. This\n",
      "child grew up in a luxury that would have stifled even her precocious\n",
      "mind had it not been for the rigid laws of the school-room. Her\n",
      "governesses and tutors were selected with a sharp eye to the number of\n",
      "titles in their reference-books, but dismissed promptly if they were\n",
      "unworthy of their hire. Later, the little Julia was sent to a\n",

      "well-being, remarkable in one so young, she divided her affectionate\n",
      "affluence among the few whose exalted station made them worth the while\n",
      "of a maiden with an indefinite future.\n",
      "These friends did not prove as useful as she had hoped. At home there\n",
      "were her parents to terrify theirs, and although she visited at several\n",
      "chateaux, and more than one title was laid at her gilded feet, she made\n",
      "up her mind to read her name in Burke.\n",
      "She took her parents for a tour round the world with a view to polishing\n",
      "off their lingering idiosyncrasies, and her chance came in India, where\n",
      "she buried them both. They succumbed to cholera, and the kindly wife of\n",
      "the viceroy, to whom she had had the forethought to secure a letter,\n",
      "sent for her to come to Simla and remain as her guest until she found\n",
      "courage and a chaperon for the return to England. Here she met Captain,\n",
      "the Honorable Augustus Kaye, heir to an ancient barony, chivalrous,\n",
      "impressionable, and hard-up. They were married with the blessings of old\n",
      "friends and new, and, to do her full justice, she made him a good wife\n",
      "according to her lights. She was quite insanely in love with him at\n",
      "first, for he looked like one of Ouida's guardsmen, and his pedigree was\n",
      "so long, and so varied with romantic historic episode, that she was\n",
      "fully a week committing it to memory.\n",
      "When he left the army and they had returned to England--via Paris--she\n",
      "had the wardrobe and establishment of a princess, the right to dine at\n",
      "the Queen's table, and not a relative in London. She was immoderately\n",
      "happy, and during the five years of her wedded life she exhausted the\n",
      "first strength of her affections, buried her feminine caprice, and\n",
      "whatever of impulse youth may have clung to as its right. When Gussy\n",
      "Kaye died, the predominant feeling in her bosom was rage at his\n",
      "inconsiderateness in leaving the world before his father, and nothing\n",
      "behind him but a courtesy prefix which she could not even use on her\n",
      "cards.\n",
      "She opened her soul to searching, and decided that five years of love\n",
      "were quite enough for any woman, and that her attentions hereafter\n",
      "should be directed towards the highest worldly success obtainable with\n",
      "brains, talents, and wealth. To be merely a rich woman in the right set\n",
      "did not come within measurable distance of her ambition's apex, and she\n",
      "determined to gratify her passionate self-love by becoming a\n",
      "personality.\n",
      "She had long since simulated the repose of the high-born Englishwoman,\n",
      "until, like all imitators, she far surpassed her models, and her manners\n",
      "were marked not so much by the caste of Vere de Vere as by an almost\n",
      "negative stolidity. This at least provided her with an unruffled front\n",
      "for trying occasions--others besides the Arcots were insensible of her\n",
      "offerings--which in the United States of America would have been\n",
      "admiringly characterized as \"nerve.\" This manner became solidified after\n",
      "her popular husband's death, and if it was generally referred to as\n",
      "\"aplomb\" or \"poise,\" allowances must be made for the poverty of the\n",
      "average vocabulary.\n",
      "It is not difficult for a clever, handsome, correct, and wealthy woman\n",
      "to reach and hold a distinctive position even in London, that world's\n",
      "headquarters of individualities. In addition to a judiciously lavish\n",
      "hospitality, it is only necessary to personalize intelligently, and this\n",
      "Mrs. Kaye did with an industry that would have carried her to greatness\n",
      "had she been granted a spark of the divine fire. She cultivated the\n",
      "great and the fashionable in art, letters, and the drama, mixed them\n",
      "tactfully with her titles, attended the banquets of the ruling class in\n",
      "Bohemia attired flatteringly in her best, and founded a society for the\n",
      "study of Leonardo da Vinci. She became intimate with several royal\n",
      "ladies, who were charmed with her endless power to amuse them and her\n",
      "magnificent patronage of their charities; and she formed close relations\n",
      "with other dames but a degree less exalted, and generally more\n",
      "discriminating. She cultivated a witty habit of speech, the society of\n",
      "cabinet ministers, and her _chef_ was a celebrity. Her gowns would have\n",
      "been notable in New York, and she was wise enough to avoid eccentricity\n",
      "and openly to regard all forms of sensationalism with a haughty disdain.\n",
      "Her attitude to men was equally well-advised. Detrimentals and\n",
      "ineligibles never so much as came up for inspection; she had a\n",
      "far-reaching sense of selection and a proper notion of the value of\n",
      "time. Therefore, the many that had the run of her luxurious mansion\n",
      "contributed personally to her prestige, and she flattered herself that\n",
      "her particular band was little less distinguished than the Royal\n",
      "Household. And they invariably found her witty, entertaining, or, like\n",
      "Madame Recamier, ready to listen \"avec seduction.\" Her knowledge of\n",
      "politics was practically unbounded.\n",
      "In such moments as she happened to be alone with any of her swains, she\n",
      "became distractingly personal, inviting, gently repelling, afforded\n",
      "dazzling glimpses of possibilities awaiting time and the man: so\n",
      "accomplishing the double purpose of agreeably titillating her own depths\n",
      "and wearing the halo of a well-behaved Circe. Altogether her success was\n",
      "what it always must be when brains and ambition, money and a cold heart\n",
      "are allied; but it was small wonder if the head of the daughter of the\n",
      "House of Tippett was a trifle turned and certain of her perceptions were\n",
      "blunted.\n",
      "Although ofttimes large with complacency, she by no means lost sight of\n",
      "her original purpose to wed a coronet, and if she endured four years of\n",
      "widowhood it was merely because she knew that she could afford to wait\n",
      "for transcendence. This she had finally run to earth in Lord Brathland,\n",
      "imminent heir to a dukedom, and personally more agreeable to her than\n",
      "any man in London. That he was notoriously inconstant but added zest to\n",
      "the chase, and it was, perhaps, the illusion she at times achieved of a\n",
      "certain resemblance to the ladies of his preference that finally\n",
      "overcame his intense aversion from respectability. He had offered\n",
      "himself to her on the day of his undoing.\n",
      "This was the woman with whom Elton Gwynne was infatuated at the most\n",
      "critical moment of his career. Of her profound aybsses he suspected\n",
      "nothing. She reigned in his imagination as the unique woman in whom\n",
      "intellect and passion, tenderness and all the social graces united in an\n",
      "exquisite harmony. There had been a time when, dazzled by the brilliancy\n",
      "of his ascending star, and Brathland being but a name to her, she had\n",
      "considered marriage with a man who assuredly would be the next leader of\n",
      "a Liberal House, and was no less certain of being prime-minister. She\n",
      "was under no delusion that she could one day induce him to accept a\n",
      "peerage, but she was reasonably sure that Zeal would not marry again,\n",
      "and there were times when the heir looked so ill that she tightened her\n",
      "bonds about the heir-presumptive, while assuring him that she was too\n",
      "much in love with liberty to think of marriage. Even when Zeal came back\n",
      "from Norway or Sorrento looking almost well, she never permitted Gwynne\n",
      "to escape, to see so much as a corner of her ego that might disturb the\n",
      "image of herself she had created in his mind; and when she met Brathland\n",
      "and her senses swam with the subtle scent of strawberry leaves, she saw\n",
      "no reason for losing the stimulating society and flattering attentions\n",
      "of the brightest star in the political firmament. Therefore, when he was\n",
      "ready to hand, in the crushing hour of her riven ambitions, and his own\n",
      "of serenest effulgence, she promptly reflected that the distance between\n",
      "a marquisate and a dukedom was quickly traversed by a powerful\n",
      "statesman. Meanwhile, although Elton Gwynne would no doubt be a hideous\n",
      "trial as a husband, his wife's position, supported by a million in the\n",
      "funds and another in Chicago, would be one of the most brilliant in\n",
      "England. And she too had seen Lord Zeal in Piccadilly on Saturday.\n",
      "XIX\n",
      "The sudden elevation of her Jack to a marquisate, beside whose roots,\n",
      "gripping the foundations of Britain's aristocracy, and ramifying the\n",
      "length and breadth of its society, the lost dukedom was a mere mushroom,\n",
      "created for a favorite of the last George, and notorious for its\n",
      "_mesalliances_, did not cost Mrs. Kaye a moment's loss of poise. She\n",
      "merely wondered that she had ever questioned her star. People that\n",
      "disliked her found a subtle suggestion of arrogance in her manner, and\n",
      "the slight significant smile on her large firm lips was a trifle more\n",
      "stereotyped. Those that she favored with the abundance of her offerings\n",
      "remembered afterwards that she had never been so brilliant as during the\n",
      "month that followed the announcement of her bethrothal, and attributed\n",
      "the fact to the electrified springs of affection.\n",
      "Gwynne and she had been invited to the same houses for the rest of the\n",
      "autumn, but he cancelled his engagements while begging her to fulfil\n",
      "hers, as he should be too busy to entertain her were she so sweet as to\n",
      "insist upon coming to Capheaton. This she had not the least intention of\n",
      "doing, for she not only yearned for the additional tribute due to her,\n",
      "but she always avoided long sojourns in Lady Victoria's vicinity,\n",
      "knowing her as a woman of caprice, who often dropped people as abruptly\n",
      "as she took them up. Susceptible to the charm of novelty, so far Mrs.\n",
      "Kaye had wholly pleased her; but the clever Julia gauged the depths of\n",
      "her future mother-in-law's credulity and kept her distance. With all her\n",
      "reason for self-gratulation, in the depths of her cynical soul she was\n",
      "quite aware of her natural inferiority to the women she emulated in all\n",
      "but their license. That prerogative, with the wisdom that had marked her\n",
      "upward course, she had flagrantly avoided, knowing that the world is\n",
      "complacent only to those that fire its snobbishness, never to those that\n",
      "fan the flame; and while she bitterly envied these women, she never\n",
      "forgot the market value of her own unimpeachable virtue. She could not\n",
      "in any case have been the slave of her passions, but her serenity was\n",
      "sometimes ruffled as she reflected that, in spite of eminence achieved,\n",
      "her caution in this and in other respects branded her in her secret soul\n",
      "as second rate.\n",
      "But if she tactfully did not insist upon flying to Capheaton, she wrote\n",
      "such charming letters, happily free of solecisms, that Gwynne wondered\n",
      "at his failure to sound the depths of her charm. But he refrained from\n",
      "meeting her, and the reason was that he was slowly working towards a\n",
      "momentous decision, and wished to arm himself at all points before\n",
      "braving her possible disapproval. When he was his cool normal collected\n",
      "self again, he gave way to his impatience to see the woman he had every\n",
      "reason to believe was deeply in love with him. He telegraphed her a\n",
      "peremptory appeal to go up to her house in London, and she was too wise\n",
      "to refuse. It was now October and London quite bearable. She telegraphed\n",
      "to her servants to strip her house of its summer shroud, and returned\n",
      "early on the day of his choice.\n",
      "It is hardly necessary to state that Mrs. Kaye lived in Park Lane. She\n",
      "had cultivated half-tones with a notable success, but to symbolize her\n",
      "new estate was a temptation it had not occurred to her to resist.\n",
      "Shortly after her return from India she had bought a large house in the\n",
      "facade of London, and furnished it with a luxury that satisfied one of\n",
      "the deepest cravings of her being, while her admirable sense of balance\n",
      "saved her from the peculiar extravagances of the cocotte.\n",
      "She had seen Lady Victoria's expressive boudoir at Capheaton, and its\n",
      "mate in Curzon Street, and relieved the envy they inspired in a caustic\n",
      "epigram that happily did not reach the insolent beauty's ear. \"These old\n",
      "coquettes,\" she had lisped, with an amused uplift of one eyebrow. \"They\n",
      "surround themselves with the atmosphere of the demi-monde and forget\n",
      "that a wrinkle is as fatal as a chaperon.\"\n",
      "The pictures in her own house were as correct as they were costly, and\n",
      "she had no boudoir. She invariably received her guests in the\n",
      "drawing-room, an immense and unique apartment, with a frieze of dusky\n",
      "copies of old masters, all of a size, and all framed in gilt as dim with\n",
      "time. From them depended a tapestry of crimson silk brocade of\n",
      "uncheckered surface. By a cunning arrangement of furniture the great\n",
      "room was broken up into a semblance of smaller ones, each with its group\n",
      "of comfortable chairs, its tea-table, or book case, or cabinet of\n",
      "bibelots, or open hearth. And all exhaled the inviting atmosphere of\n",
      "occupation.\n",
      "Mrs. Kaye, rested, and more self-possessed than if the hastening lover\n",
      "had been the late Lord Brathland, but agreeably stirred nevertheless,\n",
      "awaited the new peer in a charming corner before a screen of dull gold,\n",
      "the last reviews on a table beside her, the afternoon sun shining in on\n",
      "her healthy unworn face. When he entered and advanced impetuously across\n",
      "the room she decided that he certainly was a dear, even if he lacked the\n",
      "fascination of Brathland and his kind. And his halo was almost visible.\n",
      "She therefore yielded enchantingly when he enveloped her, smothered her,\n",
      "stormed her lips, and even pulled her hair. She finally got him over to\n",
      "the little sofa--she had advanced to meet him--but remained in his arm,\n",
      "the very picture of tender voluptuous young womanhood. Indeed, she was\n",
      "well pleased, and found her Jack, with that light blazing in his eyes,\n",
      "quite handsome, and fascinating in his own boyish imperious\n",
      "self-confident way.\n",
      "It was half an hour before she rang for tea, and then she looked so\n",
      "pretty and domestic on the other side of the little table, with its\n",
      "delicate and costly service, that Gwynne was obliged to pause and summon\n",
      "all his resolution before proceeding to another subject that possessed\n",
      "him as fully as herself; but he succeeded, for not even passion could\n",
      "turn him from his course; and she gave him his opening.\n",
      "\"Poor Lord Strathland!\" she exclaimed, with a tear in her throat. \"He\n",
      "was always so jolly and amusing, quite the most cheerful person I ever\n",
      "met. And before your cousin became--lost his health--we were great\n",
      "friends. Indeed he never quite forgot me. But it was for you I was so\n",
      "horribly cut up. I cried for two nights.\"\n",
      "\"Did you? But I was positive you did not make those tears in your first\n",
      "letter with your hair-brush.\" He laughed like a happy school-boy, while\n",
      "she protested with a roughish expression that made her look like a very\n",
      "young girl.\n",
      "\"It need not prevent our immediate marriage,\" he said. \"What do you say\n",
      "to the last of this month?\"\n",
      "\"I could get ready. Only girls, who never have any clothes, poor things,\n",
      "get trousseaux in these days. I had set my heart upon spending the\n",
      "honeymoon at the Abbey, but it would be rather indecent yet awhile;\n",
      "don't you think so?\"\n",
      "He had not an atom of tact and rushed upon his doom. \"We shall have to\n",
      "cut the Abbey,\" he said, firmly. \"I start for California three weeks\n",
      "from to-day.\"\n",
      "\"Indeed?\" she said, stiffly. \"I should have thought you would have\n",
      "consulted me. Not but that I shall be enchanted to visit California,\n",
      "but--well, you _are_ rather lordly, you know.\"\n",
      "\"My dear girl, I have been too harassed to consider the amenities. And\n",
      "when a man is rearranging his whole life he must isolate himself or run\n",
      "the risk of clouds in his judgment.\"\n",
      "He paused. She disguised her mortification and answered, kindly: \"I can\n",
      "understand that in this sudden demand for readjustment you have had many\n",
      "bad moments. It was far too soon for you to go up to the Peers'. But\n",
      "with your marvellous energies, your genius--there is no other word for\n",
      "it--you can soon astonish the world anew with a patent for\n",
      "defossilization. At all events the Peers' will enter upon a new life as\n",
      "a sort of mastodon cave swept out and illuminated by the most energetic\n",
      "and aspiring of knights-errant.\"\n",
      "Gwynne laughed dryly. \"The role does not appeal to me; nor any other in\n",
      "the same setting. I have done a month of the hardest thinking of my\n",
      "life. Everything that went before looks like child's play. I have\n",
      "arrived at the definite conclusion that my career in England has come\n",
      "to a full stop, and I have made up my mind to create another--out of\n",
      "whole cloth--in the United States.\"\n",
      "She stared at him, her face not yet unset, but her eyes expanding with\n",
      "incredulous apprehension. \"You mean to desert England?\" she asked,\n",
      "quietly.\n",
      "\"Forever. Absolutely. It is all or nothing. I cannot become an American\n",
      "citizen until five years after entering the country, and I do not wish\n",
      "to lose any valuable time. Having made up my mind, I have ceased to\n",
      "wonder if I shall like it. That is now beside the question. I shall drop\n",
      "my title as a matter of course, and hope that I shall pass undiscovered\n",
      "as John Gwynne. In short, I shall begin life all over again--as if I\n",
      "were a criminal in disguise instead of the sport of circumstances. I\n",
      "have ceased to regret the inevitable and begun to be stimulated by the\n",
      "thought of a struggle to which all that I have had here was a mere game,\n",
      "and I am sure that you, with your brains and energy, will enjoy the\n",
      "fight as much as I. I am not going into the wilderness. We shall be only\n",
      "two hours from San Francisco, which I am told is the only city in\n",
      "America that in the least suggests Europe; it should be very attractive.\n",
      "On the ranch you shall have every comfort and luxury. You must be sick\n",
      "of London, anyhow. You have conquered everything here.\"\n",
      "He paused and regarded her in some trepidation. In spite of his\n",
      "self-confidence he had had his moments of doubt. And although he had\n",
      "anticipated tears and remonstrance, he was unprepared for the more\n",
      "subtle weapon of amusement, flickering through absolute calm. He\n",
      "suddenly wished that she were younger. He had never given a thought to\n",
      "her age before, but he remembered that she had lived for two years\n",
      "longer than himself, and it made him feel even less than thirty.\n",
      "\"My dear boy,\" she said, wonderingly, \"I never heard anything so\n",
      "romantic and impossible. Of course it is the American cousin with whom\n",
      "you have been shut up all these weeks that has been putting such\n",
      "preposterous ideas into your head. I always said that nature just missed\n",
      "making you a poet. But if you wish to work out your manifest destiny--to\n",
      "be immortalized in history--you will remind yourself that England is the\n",
      "one place on earth where an Anglo-Saxon can cut a really great figure.\n",
      "Not only because he has the proper background of traditions, but because\n",
      "he has an audience trained to recognize a man's greatness during his\n",
      "lifetime. If you go in for those unspeakable American politics you will\n",
      "never be given credit for anything higher than your medium; in other\n",
      "words, should you develop into a statesman on American lines you would\n",
      "never be recognized for anything but a successful politician. Even if\n",
      "you survived in their hurly-burly of history, you would be judged by\n",
      "contemporary standards--infused with a certain contempt because you were\n",
      "not American-born.\"\n",
      "\"I have thought it all out. The obstacles to greatness, even more than\n",
      "to success, have whetted my appetite for the struggle. I must fight!\n",
      "fight! fight! I must exercise my powers of usefulness to some good end,\n",
      "and now, now, when I am young and ardent. I should go mad sitting round\n",
      "doing nothing. I have no temper for attacking the passive resistance of\n",
      "inertia. I want to fight out in the open. If I fail I will take my\n",
      "beating like a man. But I have not the least intention of failing. I am\n",
      "acutely aware of the powers within me, and I can use them anywhere.\"\n",
      "\"Then why not in the Upper House?\" she asked, quickly.\n",
      "\"For the reasons I have given you, and because I should fear the results\n",
      "on my character. You know what it means to be a peer of Great Britain.\n",

      "bitterly before, not even in her youth, when snubs were frequent. For\n",
      "the third time she watched a coronet slip through her strong determined\n",

      "furious sense of failure, she overshot her mark, and before she\n",

      "possession of him. He still felt stripped, lashed, a presumptuous youth\n",
      "before a scornful woman in the ripeness of her maturity, but it was\n",
      "imperative for his future self-respect that he should reassert his\n",
      "manhood and retire in good order. He let her finish, and then, as she\n",
      "stood with a still impatience, he lifted his eyes and drew himself up.\n",
      "His face was devoid of expression. His eyes did not even glitter; he\n",

      "criticism, mockingly maintained its hold upon the very roots of her\n",
      "being, like the city of her birth. Her childhood's memories of it\n",

      "always migratory people were rivalling the splendors of Nob Hill--as\n",
      "that craggy height had long since humbled South Park and Rincon Hill\n",
      "into their abundant dust. She also cherished many charming memories of\n",
      "her mother, with dinner or ball-gown so prudently looped under her\n",

      "never so much as a glimpse of San Francisco until she was sixteen, when\n",
      "her father was induced to visit his adopted daughter and take his\n",
      "youngest martyr with him. Isabel had planned for this visit throughout\n",
      "six long months, and arrived in the city of her heart radiant in a frock\n",
      "every breadth of which was new--heretofore her wardrobe had risen like\n",
      "an apologetic ph[oe]nix from the moth-eaten remnants of her mother's old\n",
      "finery--and such uncompromising trust in the benevolence of fate as a\n",
      "girl rarely knows twice in a lifetime. There were three days of\n",
      "enchanted prowling about the old house on Russian Hill, where, as the\n",
      "tenant, in the rocking-chair by the bedroom window, did not invite her\n",
      "to enter, she consoled herself with the views and the memories; and of\n",
      "an even more normal delight in the shopping streets and gay restaurants\n",
      "of a real city. After that the visit existed in her mind with the\n",
      "confused outlines of a nightmare.\n",
      "Her adopted sister's peevish complaints at being obliged to remain in\n",
      "the foggy windy city all summer, the crying baby, the whirlwinds of dust\n",
      "and shivering nights, she might have dismissed as unworthy the spirit of\n",
      "sixteen, and dreamed herself happy. But Mr. Otis, who had been sober for\n",
      "seven months, selected this occasion for a fall which resounded from\n",
      "Market Street to Telegraph Hill, and rejuvenated the long line of\n",
      "saloons that had graced Montgomery Street since the days when \"Jim\" Otis\n",
      "had been one of the wildest spirits in the wildest city on earth. That\n",
      "was \"back in the Sixties,\" when his lapses were as far apart as they\n",
      "were unrivalled in consumption, span, and pyrotechny. By the late\n",
      "Eighties he had disappeared into the north, and the careless city knew\n",
      "him no more.\n",
      "During the Seventies and early Eighties there had been a period of\n",
      "reform, incident upon his marriage with a pretty and high-spirited girl,\n",
      "and one of the city's estimable attempts to clean out its political\n",
      "stables. His brilliant and desperate encounter with Boss Buckley was\n",
      "historic, but its failure, and the indifference of the gay contented\n",
      "majority to the city's underworld, soured him and struck a fatal blow at\n",
      "the never vital roots of personal ambition. When he began to water the\n",
      "roots at his old haunts, the finish of his career and of his splendid\n",
      "inheritance passed into the region of problems that Time solves so\n",
      "easily. When she solved his problem he was glad to subside into one of\n",
      "his cottages in Rosewater. Here he reformed and collapsed, reformed and\n",
      "collapsed; but, with fewer temptations, and a remnant of his legal\n",
      "brilliancy, he supported his family after a fashion; and fed his pride\n",
      "to the day of his death with the fact that his wife, unlike the\n",
      "forgotten half of many another comet, had never been obliged to do her\n",
      "own work.\n",
      "During that last visit to San Francisco, Isabel, guided by her amused\n",
      "brother-in-law, routed him out of no less than fourteen saloons, and\n",
      "spent night after night walking the streets with him to conquer the\n",
      "restlessness that otherwise would find a prolonged surcease beyond her\n",
      "influence. When she finally steered him back to Rosewater he fell into\n",
      "an exuberant fit of repentance, during which he was so charming and so\n",
      "legal that Isabel forgave him, laid by her bitterness and\n",
      "mortification, and hoped. But although no repentance could maintain a\n",
      "grip upon that slippery flabby substance which he still called his\n",
      "character, at least he never went to San Francisco again. Occasionally\n",
      "he permitted Isabel to spend a week with her sister, while he pledged\n",
      "himself to good behavior during her absence; and kept his word. He\n",
      "always kept his word; and he took care to withhold it except when he was\n",
      "sure of himself. Isabel decided that as everything was relative it was\n",
      "better to have a dipsomaniac as her life portion than a drinking-machine\n",
      "of more steady and industrious habits.\n",
      "Finally his patient clients left him, he sold the cottage in\n",
      "Rosewater--all that remained of his inheritance--to pay its mortgages,\n",
      "and moved with Isabel out to the ranch-house, preserved with a few\n",
      "hundred acres by the more canny and less thirsty Hiram. When the elder\n",
      "brother died James would have returned forthwith to the sources of\n",
      "supply, but by this time Isabel had the upper hand, and although he\n",
      "disappeared for days at a time, he was always forced to return to the\n",
      "ranch when the small monthly sum allowed him by the terms of his\n",
      "brother's will was exhausted; no one in Rosewater would give him credit.\n",
      "As he invariably left a note behind him promising to \"be quiet about\n",
      "it,\" Isabel ceased to haunt his footsteps. His appetite was far beyond\n",
      "his control or hers, and as he kept his word and spent his time in the\n",
      "back parlor of a saloon, and had no longer the digestive capacity to\n",
      "achieve his former distinction, she merely sat at home and waited.\n",
      "Fortunately he did not live long enough after his brother hopelessly to\n",
      "embitter his daughter's youth. Liberty came to her when she had ceased\n",
      "to hate with young intolerance and begun to pity; and before too much\n",
      "longing for freedom, and its insidious suggestions, had poisoned her\n",
      "nature. Indeed, when she had seen her father buried with much pomp in\n",
      "the cemetery behind Rosewater, and returned to the permanent peace of\n",
      "her home, she missed her cares and responsibilities, so long and\n",
      "systematically borne, and mourned, not as a child for its parent, but as\n",
      "an adoptive mother suddenly bereft. Nevertheless, she was bent upon\n",
      "enjoying her freedom to the utmost and rebelled against the obduracy of\n",
      "her uncle's executors, who disapproved of her pilgrimage to Europe\n",
      "unattended by a matron of Rosewater. Hiram Otis, who trusted no man, had\n",
      "appointed four executors; and had not Judge Leslie been one of them the\n",
      "other three might have delayed the settling of the estate beyond the\n",
      "legal term. But at the end of a year Isabel was absolute mistress of her\n",
      "property and herself.\n",
      "One of the happiest moments of her life was when she sat before her\n",
      "lawyer's table in San Francisco and watched the pen strokes that\n",
      "cancelled the mortgage of the house on Russian Hill. The house and its\n",
      "acre, encumbered by the inevitable mortgage, had been all that remained\n",
      "of Mrs. Otis's personal inheritance when she left San Francisco for\n",
      "ever. James Otis had promised his dying wife that he would never sell\n",
      "the place, which she bequeathed to Isabel; and when his last client left\n",
      "him and he could no longer pay the interest, Hiram, who was morosely\n",
      "devoted to his niece, met the yearly obligation: he would not redeem the\n",
      "mortgage unless he were permitted to buy the property. But to this James\n",
      "Otis, clinging to his solitary virtue, would not consent; and Hiram,\n",
      "although he intended to leave all he possessed to Isabel, could not\n",
      "bring himself to part with any sum in four figures.\n",
      "Before leaving for Europe Isabel had leased the house to a young\n",
      "newspaper man whose wife had an income of her own, and not only an\n",
      "artistic appreciation of the view, but a more practical esteem for a\n",
      "site so far removed from the \"all-night life\" below. Immediately after\n",
      "Isabel's return Mrs. Glait had asked permission to sublet the house,\n",
      "remarking cynically that time had inured her to the desultory phenomena\n",
      "of journalism, but never to the stable prospect of her husband's death\n",
      "struggle with foot-pads, or her children falling down the cliff of this\n",
      "wild bit of nature in the heart of a city.\n",
      "Isabel took back her old home with another spasm of delight, and vowed\n",
      "that not until she was a pauper would she part with it again. Five or\n",
      "six days of every week must be spent on the chicken-ranch, which had\n",
      "grown to such proportions that she was now one of the persons that\n",
      "counted in her flourishing community. But in time she would live more\n",
      "and more in her lofty home, become a notable figure in San Francisco,\n",
      "drawing with both hands from its varied best; and meanwhile, once a\n",
      "week, she could sit for hours and look down upon the city, which, even\n",
      "in rainy weather, was a wild and beautiful sight from her eyrie.\n",
      "Mrs. Otis had been a niece of the Mrs. Montgomery who had reigned on\n",
      "Rincon Hill twenty years ago, and a cousin of the Helena Belmont who had\n",
      "been the greatest belle the city had seen since that earlier time when\n",

      "time it looked as if Gordon Belmont would be a far richer man than his\n",
      "famous brother, Colonel Jack, always contented with a modest million;\n",
      "but in ten mad days there was a decline of sixty million dollars in the\n",

      "later, when he died of sheer exhaustion, he had nothing to leave his\n",

      "supplemented by her uncle and guardian until her marriage. She was\n",
      "thirteen at her father's death, and as her mother had preceded him, she\n",

      "marriage as a \"bad debt.\" His wife, too, had insisted upon living in it,\n",
      "for reasons subsequently understood by her daughter and Mrs. Glait, and\n",
      "complacently enlarged it with all the hideous improvements of the day.\n",
      "That part of Russian Hill conspicuous from the city is little more than\n",
      "a great cliff rising abruptly from the extreme north end of the graded\n",
      "ledge on the summit of Nob Hill, which, in its turn, almost overhangs\n",
      "the steep and populous ascent from the valley. In \"early days\" none but\n",

      "the brush was so thick and the titles so uncertain that their future\n",
      "distinction was undreamed of. Then came a determined period of grading\n",
      "which embraced the heights in due course, titles were settled, and many\n",

      "she could not be the first to plant a bit of ancient Athens upon a brown\n",
      "and ragged bluff, the high tide of her fortunes should coincide with the\n",
      "awakening of the city to the sense of its architectural guilt. She\n",
      "banished much of the tasteless furniture of the old time, and refitted\n",
      "with a stately comfort that expressed one side of her nature. She too\n",
      "clung to traditions--and to the long mirrors in their tarnished gilt\n",
      "frames, with the little shelf below; the multitude of family portraits\n",
      "engraved on wood, and surrounded by a wide white margin and tiny gilt\n",
      "frame. That they might strike no discordant note, she made use of a\n",
      "lesson learned in London, where she had spent a month with Lady\n",
      "Victoria, and had the walls and wood of the living-room painted white,\n",
      "covered the windows and furniture with a plain stuff of a dark but\n",
      "neutral blue. In the dining-room were a few paintings of her New England\n",
      "and Spanish ancestors, and she disturbed them only to replace the\n",

      "conventional number of rooms and hallways. The house, of no great depth,\n",

      "Mrs. Belmont and Mrs. Otis, in the time-honored American fashion, had\n",

      "lingering provincialism, and lived luxuriously in the big room\n",
      "down-stairs when she was not in the porch. She had reserved her mother's\n",
      "old alcoved bedroom with its mahogany four-poster for her own use, but\n",

      "cousins, that they too might have headquarters in town.\n",
      "Neither appeared to be in any haste to visit the city of their\n",
      "ancestors. Gwynne had left England in October, now nearly a year ago,\n",
      "but, having discovered from his solicitor that he could apply for\n",
      "letters of citizenship as late as the end of the third year after\n",
      "landing, had announced to Isabel his intention to travel slowly about\n",
      "the country \"before settling down in its remotest part, which, from all\n",
      "accounts, was sufficiently unlike the rest to provincialize his point of\n",
      "view unless he saw something first of the East, South, and Middle West.\"\n",
      "He had written to her several times, but only on business. She had\n",
      "returned in January, after a round of visits in England, and had put his\n",
      "house in order at once. The lease had expired, and Mr. Colton had\n",
      "engaged a temporary superintendent, but Gwynne sent Isabel his power of\n",
      "attorney and she was temporarily in possession. She wrote to him from\n",
      "time to time that all was well, or to send him an account of her\n",
      "expenditures; but felt no promptings towards a friendly correspondence\n",
      "with one who showed as little disposition to encourage it.\n",
      "From Victoria she had not heard directly since she bade her good-bye in\n",
      "Curzon Street, but Flora Thangue had written that her ladyship's superb\n",
      "health had (to her ill-concealed fury) given way, following an attack of\n",
      "influenza, and she would not be able to leave her doctor for an\n",
      "indefinite time. A few months later she wrote that \"dear Vicky\" was\n",
      "outwardly herself again, but in reality very nervous, the result, no\n",
      "doubt, of her illness, and of the prolonged stress of business. However,\n",
      "she had finally succeeded in letting the Abbey and Capheaton to\n",
      "advantage, and it was on the cards that she would reach California\n",
      "before the end of the year. Isabel hoped that, unfed by her son's\n",
      "exacting presence the maternal fires burned low; she had a clearly\n",
      "defined intention to be a factor in the new career of Elton Gwynne, and\n",
      "no desire for the capricious interference of his mother.\n",
      "II\n",
      "As Isabel stood in her little porch that brilliant September morning,\n",
      "she dismissed her occasional regret that she had not remained in England\n",
      "for a London season. Not only had she put the time to better use on her\n",
      "ranch, but no doubt her agent would have relet this house, and delayed\n",
      "the fulfilment of one of those dreams upon which she unconsciously fed\n",
      "her soul. The shrieking trade-winds and the dense white fogs were\n",
      "hibernating somewhere out in the Pacific. All the city, in the great\n",
      "irregular amphitheatre below, was sharply outlined in the yellow light;\n",
      "Isabel wondered if the sun renewed its stores from the golden veins to\n",
      "north and south. On the wide broken ledge just beneath her pinnacle was\n",
      "the concrete evidence of an architectural orgy to be seen nowhere else\n",
      "on earth: wooden mansions with the pure outlines of the Renaissance; a\n",
      "Gothic palace with bow-windows, also of wood; a big brown-stone house in\n",
      "the style of New York; piles of shingles and stones; here and there a\n",
      "touch of Romanesque, later French, and Italian; the majority of those\n",
      "plutocratic and perishable masses, of no style in particular, unless it\n",
      "were that of Mansard combined with the criminalities of him who invented\n",
      "the bow-window and the irrelevant tower. On the slopes were a few old\n",
      "houses in gardens, some with cottage roofs, others square, brown, dusty,\n",
      "melancholy. But the majority were of the \"house in a row\" type,\n",
      "radiating in all directions from the \"boarding-house blocks\" on the\n",
      "lower slopes. Then, down on the plain, came the big compact masses of\n",
      "stone and concrete, brick and steel, devoted to business and housing of\n",
      "the itinerant. The lofty domes of the City Hall and a newspaper\n",
      "building, a few church spires and the great white-stone hotel on a crest\n",
      "not far from Isabel's, were the sole pretenders to architectural beauty\n",
      "within her ken.\n",
      "Far away she could make out the Mission Church, once called after St.\n",
      "Francis of Assisi, now named Dolores for the vanished lake. It was the\n",
      "last reminder of the work of the Spanish fathers, and looked\n",
      "indescribably ancient in the midst of that busy and densely populated\n",
      "district. At night Isabel watched the lights of the electric cars\n",
      "flashing about that old monument of an almost forgotten conquest--like\n",
      "the angry haunted eyes of the padres that had labored in the wilderness\n",
      "for naught. But although this old church and the Presidio, which still\n",
      "retained its quadrangle and a few of the original adobe houses, appealed\n",
      "deeply to Isabel on account of the romance of Rezanov and Concha\n",
      "Argueello that distinguished her family, her more personal sympathies\n",
      "were with the streets just below her hill-top, packed as they were with\n",
      "memories, tragic, humorous, gay, pathetic, of a people that had made the\n",
      "city great.\n",
      "Even the dilapidated houses, with their sixty steps or more toppling\n",
      "above the cut that had widened and levelled the street, had been very\n",
      "hospitable in their time, and Isabel knew that her mother and\n",
      "grandmother had toiled up those perpendicular flights in satin slippers\n",
      "and ballooning skirts on many a rainy night. Mrs. Otis had told her\n",
      "little girls stories of all those old houses, fine and simple, more\n",
      "particularly of the fortunate mansions on Nob Hill's brief level. Isabel\n",
      "longed for the time when she should enter them and pick up the threads\n",
      "dropped from her mother's nerveless fingers. The Belmont house was\n",
      "closed, the still restless Helena occupying a palace in Rome at the\n",
      "moment. The Polk house had been sold to the energetic son of one of the\n",
      "plodding old money-makers that had fought shy of stock gambling and\n",
      "railroads. Nicolas Hofer belonged to the latest type the prolific city\n",
      "had bred: the son of a millionaire, but a keen man of business, whom the\n",
      "wildness of the city had never tempted, highly educated, honorable, and\n",
      "an ardent reformer.\n",
      "Magdalena Yorba--Mrs. Trennahan--like most of her old neighbors, still\n",
      "dwelt in the ancestral mansion, although she had given it a stucco\n",
      "facade and shaved off the bow-windows. In each, Isabel was sure of\n",
      "welcome, and she longed particularly to wander through the old Polk\n",
      "house, where one of her Spanish great-aunts had reigned for a time. Like\n",
      "all San Franciscans of family, she took more pride in her young-old city\n",
      "than a Roman in his Rome. Its forty-two square miles had seen so many\n",
      "changes, its story was so romantic and unique, that its age was not to\n",
      "be measured by the standards of Time. Her grandfather had stood on this\n",
      "hill after his Sunday climb and looked over and down a ragged wilderness\n",
      "to the city bursting out of its shell--a wretched huddle of shacks and\n",
      "tents by the water's edge. The bay no doubt was crowded with ships from\n",
      "every corner of the world, many of them deserted, unmanned, forced to\n",
      "lie idle until the return of the hungry disappointed gold-seekers. That\n",
      "was less than sixty years ago. In the first ten years of its rapid\n",
      "growth the city had burned seven times, millions blazing out in an hour.\n",
      "To-day San Francisco was replete not only with life but with wealth,\n",
      "talents, and every variety of enterprise; it was as full of fads and\n",
      "cults and artistic groups as London itself; it had sent forth authors,\n",
      "artists, mummers, singers--and millionaires by the score. Many of the\n",
      "art treasures of the world had been brought here and hidden from the\n",
      "vulgar in those awful impermanent \"palatial mansions.\" Some of the\n",
      "finest libraries of the world were here. It had its bibliomaniacs, its\n",
      "collectors, its precieux. And yet what a lonely city it was, stranded on\n",
      "the edge of the still half-vacant western section of the United States,\n",
      "with all the Pacific before it. Save for the rim of towns across the\n",
      "bay, which were little more than a part of itself, it watched the Orient\n",
      "alone, and was far too gay and careless, too self-absorbed and insolent,\n",
      "to keep its jaws on the alert. Tact it was much too high-handed to\n",
      "cultivate. It welcomed the hungry Oriental for so long as he was useful,\n",
      "and when he outstayed his welcome, incontinently kicked him out. San\n",
      "Francisco's intensity of independence as well as of civic pride was due\n",
      "in part no doubt to the isolation which compelled it to be self-centred,\n",
      "and to its unconscious dislike of the elder breeds beyond the Rocky\n",
      "Mountains; but largely to the old adventurous reckless gambling spirit\n",
      "and the habit of sleeping on its pistol. These first causes had\n",
      "developed individuality to such proportions that the hair of a\n",
      "Californian bristled when he was alluded to as a \"Westerner,\" or even as\n",
      "a mere American.\n",
      "And with time the patriotism of the San Franciscan waxed rather than\n",
      "waned. It was no longer the fashion to take one's money to New York,\n",
      "merely because of the higher cost of living that made a millionaire\n",
      "\"feel his oats,\" and of the allure of the older and more difficult\n",
      "society to his women. San Franciscans still fled from the winds and fogs\n",
      "of summer to their beloved Europe, and country-house life gained ground\n",
      "very slowly, but deserters were few; and of late the rich men had shown\n",
      "their faith not only by investing the greater part of their capital in\n",
      "the city--until \"improved real estate\" was become a current phrase--but\n",
      "the best of them, including Hofer and the mayor who had preceded the\n",
      "present figurehead and his omnivorous Boss, were engaged in a desperate\n",
      "battle with the highly organized gang of political ruffians that owned\n",
      "and pillaged and dishonored the city in a manner with which nothing in\n",
      "the history of municipal corruption could compare save the old Tweed\n",
      "Ring of New York. For at least ten years previous to 1901, San Francisco\n",
      "had enjoyed a period of not only decent but honorable government. There\n",
      "was no \"graft\" in high places, the city was out of debt, it held up its\n",
      "head with the cleanest municipal governments in the land. But, as ever,\n",
      "the disinterested grew somnolent with content, and gave no heed to the\n",
      "burrowing of the hungry recuperated and wiser rats in that prolific\n",
      "underworld whence never a high-minded citizen emerges. The few that saw\n",
      "and warned were disregarded; and circumstances, proper in themselves,\n",
      "swelled the ranks of the petty politicians with thousands of greedy and\n",
      "insurgent laborers. San Francisco awoke one morning to find herself in\n",
      "the drag-net of a machine to which old Boss Buckley and the illustrious\n",
      "Tammany doffed their hats. But the majority still gave little heed, too\n",
      "content in their various blessings, and the gay light spirit the\n",
      "climate gave them, to foresee the time when their pleasant city would be\n",
      "utterly debauched, and life among arrogant thieves, prostitutes, and\n",
      "socialists have become as impracticable as it already was in Chinatown\n",
      "or on Barbary Coast.\n",
      "A group of the more thoughtful and patriotic citizens, assisted by the\n",
      "one militant editor the city boasted, were doing all that was humanly\n",
      "possible to prevent the re-election of the mayor, who had already\n",
      "represented the worst element twice, and to break the power of the Boss.\n",
      "Isabel in her lonely ranch house, when her chickens were asleep,\n",
      "followed the fight with a passionate interest, and was tempted to come\n",
      "forth from her seclusion and meet at least the representative men of her\n",
      "city. But she was not yet ready to take up her own share of the burden,\n",
      "and was far too modest to imagine that she could be useful until she had\n",
      "become a person of importance in San Francisco. Nevertheless, as she\n",
      "looked down to-day on the sharp outlines of the city under the hard blue\n",
      "sky, almost glittering in their golden bath, she was impatient to become\n",
      "a part of its life, or at least to discuss its interests with some one.\n",
      "Rosewater, which of late years had become virtuous to excess, and almost\n",
      "blind and deaf with local pride, took no interest in San Francisco\n",
      "whatever, except as a market for eggs. When driven to the wall it\n",
      "confessed the superiority of the metropolis in the matter of shops and\n",
      "theatres; but its politics it invariably dismissed with adjectives more\n",
      "forcible than elegant.\n",
      "It was at this point in Isabel's meditations that her eye happened to\n",
      "rove along the plank walk to the rickety old flight of steps that led\n",
      "from Taylor Street up Russian Hill. There was something vaguely\n",
      "familiar about a tall, thin, well-groomed, but by no means graceful,\n",
      "figure rapidly ascending the steps. In a moment her mind lost its\n",
      "tensity of projection and she was almost flying down her own long stair.\n",
      "Gwynne broke into a run as he saw her. She wondered if he intended to\n",
      "kiss her, but he merely shook her hand for a full minute.\n",
      "\"I never in my life was so glad to see anybody!\" he exclaimed, with the\n",
      "joyousness of a school-boy come home for his first holiday. \"It was such\n",
      "luck to hear that you were in San Francisco.\"\n",
      "\"But why didn't you telegraph? In a way I am disappointed--glad as I am\n",
      "to see you. I intended to meet you at Oakland and take you directly up\n",
      "to Lumalitas, where everything was to have been in gala array. And how\n",
      "did you know I was in town?\"\n",
      "\"While I was taking my lonely breakfast this morning--I arrived late\n",
      "yesterday afternoon--and glancing over one of your newspapers, my eye\n",

      "mistress of the old Belmont House on Russian Hill, who had excited so\n",
      "much interest of late, had come down as usual for Sunday.\"\n",
      "\"No?\" Isabel flushed for the first time within Gwynne's knowledge of\n",
      "her. \"That is the very only time I have been the subject of a newspaper\n",
      "paragraph--outside of Rosewater, which doesn't count--and I am as\n",
      "delighted--as I have no doubt you were the first time you saw your name\n",
      "in print!\" she added, defiantly.\n",
      "There was nothing cynical in Gwynne's smile. \"I understand,\" he said;\n",
      "and then, as he ceased to smile, the light died out of his face, and\n",
      "Isabel noticed that it was older and thinner. It had lost more than a\n",
      "little of its aloof serenity, and his crest was visibly lowered. But on\n",

      "suddenly awakened.\n",
      "They mounted the steep flight of steps to the house slowly, exchanging\n",
      "ejaculatory remarks. When they reached the porch she motioned to a long\n",
      "wicker chair.\n",
      "\"It is only ten,\" she said. \"Luncheon will not be ready until one, and\n",
      "my California hospitality demands that your entertainment shall begin at\n",
      "once. Make yourself comfortable while I brew you a cup of Spanish\n",
      "chocolate. I have actually one of the molinillos of our ancestors.\"\n",
      "When she returned with the frothy and fragrant beverage he was standing\n",
      "with his hands in his pockets staring down at the city. He turned\n",
      "swiftly at the sound of her step on the wood, but something was rushing\n",
      "to the back of his eyes, and once more Isabel had the singular\n",
      "impression of hearing his spirit cry: \"Oh God! Oh God!\" But his lips\n",
      "were hard pressed and his eyes became suddenly contemptuous, then\n",
      "smiling.\n",

      "Residenz--\"\n",
      "He paused and narrowed his eyes. Isabel had turned white. \"I must hear\n",

      "approachable. In New York I was at times repelled with a haughty stare\n",
      "or a negative frigidity which no duke I know could compass. But in\n",
      "Boston they were more friendly, and farther West so expansive that I was\n",
      "frequently invited to houses before I had presented my modest card. Very\n",
      "often I had long talks with newspaper men, and made no attempt to\n",
      "conceal the fact that I was a Britisher. Once or twice that fact was\n",
      "commented on, but taken as a matter of course. There are a good many\n",
      "Britishers in the United States. My identity was never suspected. I\n",
      "never saw a newspaper paragraph about myself.\"\n",
      "He laughed, but looked at her between lids so narrowed that she could\n",
      "not see the expression of his eyes. She nodded, smiling; and she could\n",
      "make her smile very sweet and encouraging.\n",
      "\"The time came when I felt like a shipwrecked mariner. Stranded!\n",
      "Abandoned! Forgotten! Finally--take all the circumstances into\n",
      "consideration and make due allowance--I felt that I would risk\n",
      "everything to see my name in print once more. I arrived in Chicago late\n",
      "one night. There had been a break-down that doubled the time of the\n",
      "beastly trip. I went to its first hotel and registered myself as Elton\n",
      "Gwynne. The night clerk, with the haughty indifference of the stage\n",
      "duke, or the New-Yorker who fancies himself, called a bell-boy and\n",
      "turned his back on me. I remained in Chicago three days. Not a reporter\n",
      "sent up his card. Not a line appeared in a newspaper. It was the most\n",
      "chastening experience of my life. No doubt it did me good. My ego has\n",
      "actually felt lighter.\" He smiled. But he added in a moment: \"It left a\n",
      "scar, nevertheless.\"\n",
      "\"Never mind,\" said Isabel, consolingly. \"All that will read delightfully\n",
      "in your biography. What on this difficult globe is not difficult, first,\n",
      "last, and always? The only thing for you to do is to snap your fingers\n",
      "at everything, as we do out here, and see nothing in the future but\n",
      "success. How do you like the land of your birth?\"\n",
      "\"I hate it!\" he said intensely. \"Washington is a crude unwieldy village.\n",
      "New York is like one of those nightmares a certain class of writers\n",
      "project and label 'Earth in the Year 2000.' Chicago is the entrails of\n",
      "the universe. The small interior towns and villages of the Eastern\n",
      "States are open mausoleums for people so old and so dried up that their\n",
      "end will be not death but desiccation. There is nothing picturesque in\n",
      "those old towns, for they were dead before they were civilized. Some of\n",
      "the cities and villages of the South are certainly attractive to look at\n",
      "and have a background of a sort, but they are as lifeless as their\n",
      "negroes. The cities of the West are hives, and when you have seen one\n",
      "you have seen all. Its smaller communities are horrors, pure and simple.\n",
      "Much of the country is magnificent. The Adirondacks, the Hudson River,\n",
      "Yellowstone, those great prairies and deserts, atone for a good deal.\n",
      "The last three weeks I have spent in southern California. It seemed to\n",
      "me--below Santa Barbara, at least--little more than a reclaimed\n",
      "desert--and with nothing of the wonderful atmospheric effects of the\n",
      "great interior deserts; nothing but dirt and a hideous low shrub caked\n",
      "with prehistoric dust. Precious little of it reclaimed at that. I am\n",
      "glad that ranch is in good hands. I never want to see the place again.\n",
      "That eternally grinning sky! That dead atmosphere! It blunted my nerves\n",
      "for the time, but the reaction is all the worse. However--\" He stood up\n",
      "and leaned over the railing. \"I did not expect the earthly paradise. I\n",
      "am not going to treat you to a continued diatribe--\"\n",
      "\"But you must like California--love it!\" cried Isabel, in alarm. \"Of\n",
      "course you have hated everything--natural enough--but not California! It\n",
      "is your State, your home, your future. You must begin by liking it, at\n",
      "least.\"\n",
      "\"Very well, mentor, I shall do my best. One might certainly indulge in\n",
      "an illusion or two up here. I thought as I walked--climbed--through the\n",
      "city, guided a part of the way by a messenger-boy, who ejaculated at\n",
      "intervals, 'Say, mister!' and described Nob Hill as the 'millionaire\n",
      "bunch,' that I had seldom seen so many ugly buildings together; but from\n",
      "this perch of yours it looks quite beautiful. Still I long for the\n",
      "country. Can we go to the ranch this afternoon?\"\n",
      "\"Why not?\" Isabel stifled a sigh. She had intended to ride all round the\n",
      "city on the electric cars; but she felt as if she had an adopted\n",
      "homesick child on her hands, and he was a responsibility that she had\n",
      "deliberately assumed. Moreover, she felt deeply sorry for him.\n",
      "\"You can express all your luggage but a portmanteau, and we will go in\n",
      "my launch. It is down on the bay side of the Hill. We must start at four\n",
      "to catch the tide. You have no idea how cosey and pretty your\n",
      "ranch-house looks, and I have sent out my uncle's law--and\n",
      "farm--library. I have arranged everything with Judge Leslie, and you\n",
      "enter his office at once. He is the first lawyer of northern\n",
      "California. I wrote you that it would be impossible to conceal the truth\n",
      "from him, as his firm has done all the legal business of the estate for\n",
      "the last thirty years, and he knows your mother has only one son. But he\n",
      "is the more interested. No one else knows but Mr. Colton and his son\n",
      "Tom--your Rosewater bankers and agents. Your secret is safe with them.\n",
      "Gwynne is not an uncommon name in California, although some of its\n",
      "letters have been dropped. Lumalitas has been leased for so many years\n",
      "that your name has ceased to be associated with it in the public mind,\n",
      "and the deeds are so deeply buried in the archives of St. Peter--the\n",
      "county-seat--that the most curious would hardly attempt to unearth them.\n",
      "Of course most townspeople all through the State take in a San Francisco\n",
      "paper, and your name has doubtless appeared now and again in the\n",
      "telegrams. But they are not the sort that take the least interest in the\n",
      "career of a young Englishman--those that do, at all events, are few and\n",
      "far between. Judge Leslie is deeply interested; so is Tom Colton, the\n",
      "only son of the bank, so to speak. He is a Democrat, by-the-way--but I\n",
      "don't suppose you have made up your mind--\"\n",
      "\"I have quite made up my mind. In practice one party seems about as bad\n",
      "as the other, but at least the Democratic ideals more nearly correspond\n",
      "with my own. Besides, the Democratic party is the under dog, and that\n",
      "always appeals to me, to say nothing of the fact that it is weak in\n",
      "strong men, that all its salient leaders are what you so elegantly term\n",
      "'blatherskites.' If I go in for American politics, I must fight so hard\n",
      "that I cannot help becoming absorbed body and soul; with only the\n",
      "present and the future--no past. Let us take a walk over these hills.\"\n",
      "III\n",
      "\"Do you run this thing yourself?\" asked Gwynne, as they boarded the\n",
      "launch, which was at anchor by the end of the sea wall at the foot of\n",
      "Russian Hill.\n",
      "\"Rather. How do you expect me to make a fortune in this paradise of the\n",
      "labor-union if I don't do things myself? I have a hard time being\n",
      "economical, and I suspect that where I save once I spend twice, but I\n",
      "try not to think about it. Theories make life so palatable! This old\n",
      "launch belonged to Uncle Hiram. I had it repaired, and take my eggs to\n",
      "the hatcheries and my produce to Rosewater three times a week. There I\n",
      "deal direct with the San Francisco buyers--and in this launch; it serves\n",
      "me very well as an office. Then I come down in it every week. The\n",
      "railroad is exorbitant, and the boats are too slow. It may be that\n",
      "gasolene and repairs cost more than a railroad fare once a week, but I\n",
      "have abstained from making a comparison. The trip is so delightful!\"\n",
      "The launch was about twenty feet long with a small cabin and a fresh\n",
      "coat of brown paint. It shot lightly over the smooth water, and Gwynne\n",
      "sat on top of the cabin above Isabel swinging his long legs, and looked\n",
      "with some envy at the hundreds of yachts that skimmed the bay. They\n",
      "appeared and vanished about the corners of the Islands and promontories\n",
      "like birds swooping after prey. The Islands and all the mainland had\n",
      "lost their greens long since, but the burnt grasses shone in the sun\n",
      "like hammered gold; were tan and brown and fawn on the shadowed eastern\n",
      "slopes. The chain of mountains beyond the towns across the bay and\n",
      "facing San Francisco glittered like bronze, but the lofty volcanic peak\n",
      "of Monte Diablo, farther still, was a pale and misty blue. North of the\n",
      "Golden Gate and high above the mountains of Marin County, Mount\n",
      "Tamalpais was so intense and hard a blue, and was cut against the\n",
      "fleckless sky with so sharp an outline, that it produced in Gwynne a\n",
      "vague sense of unreality and uneasiness. The Marconi poles on the summit\n",
      "looked like the masts of a mammoth ship, and every window of The Tavern,\n",
      "close by them, shone like a plate of brass.\n",
      "They steered for the southern point of Angel Island, and Gwynne looked\n",
      "about him with much interest. The mainland of the great northern cove\n",
      "and the eastern side of the Islands were thick with trees: oaks,\n",
      "buckeye, willows, madrono. And almost as thickly set, although sometimes\n",
      "half hidden, were the villas: light and airy of architecture, gayly\n",
      "painted, with broad verandas and overhanging vines. At the foot of\n",
      "Belvedere and the little town of Tiburon were house-boats, in which\n",
      "people lived for eight months of the year.\n",
      "And everywhere, people, people, people. They swarmed in the yachts, on\n",
      "the house-boats, on the driveways, the verandas. Gwynne twisted about\n",
      "and looked at San Francisco. The palaces were on the heights and in the\n",
      "Western Addition--out towards the Presidio and the Golden Gate; but\n",
      "hundreds of tiny dwellings clung to the precipitous sides of Telegraph\n",
      "Hill and Russian Hill as if their foundations were talons. And each had\n",
      "its bit of garden, or its balcony full of flowers. Telegraph Hill, the\n",
      "great bluff where the city turned almost at a right angle from north to\n",
      "south, was given over largely to Mexicans and Italians, and was\n",
      "uncommonly vivid. And the streets were full of people. The city had\n",
      "turned itself inside out. Everywhere were bright gowns and parasols,\n",
      "whizzing cars packed to the rails.\n",
      "And the wealthy class by no means monopolized the bay with their yachts\n",
      "and luxurious launches. There were fishing-smacks filled with whole\n",
      "families of Italians and Chinese; in fact every tongue floated over the\n",
      "water in the course of a brilliant Sunday afternoon. And at the docks\n",
      "there were steamers, sailing vessels, from all the ports of the world, a\n",
      "forest of spars and funnels; odd little Italian craft and even a Chinese\n",
      "junk. A man-of-war was coming down from Mare Island. Gwynne had seen a\n",
      "big Australian liner flying the Union Jack enter the Golden Gate as the\n",
      "launch rounded Angel Island. It made him homesick, and he was not sorry\n",
      "to lose sight of it.\n",
      "They passed steamboats crowded with holiday seekers coming home from a\n",
      "day's outing in Sausalito, San Rafael, Mill Valley, sporting parks; the\n",
      "majority noisy and vulgar, but a mass of color. It was a scene of\n",
      "surpassing variety, life, gayety, prosperity, importance. Gwynne, as the\n",
      "light electrical breeze began to prick his veins, experienced a\n",
      "sensation of pride in the country where his lines were cast, in those\n",
      "ancestors of his that had memorably helped to develop its vast\n",
      "resources: a tremendous concession, for he had barely acknowledged these\n",
      "ancestors before. A slight meed of resignation descended upon him. He\n",
      "smiled down upon Isabel, who was frowning at the sun and sighing for\n",
      "her forgotten veil; she had a tender regard for her complexion. Gwynne\n",
      "thought her very pretty in her smart crash suit and sailor hat, not\n",
      "nearly so severe and fateful in appearance as when she had adjusted\n",
      "herself to the formalities of Capheaton; although he remembered that he\n",
      "had heard much discussion of her beauty and had not been unappreciative\n",
      "himself. But he liked her far better here in California. Her eyes were\n",
      "more alert, her voice was less monotonous; and those little black moles\n",
      "looked particularly fascinating on the ivory white of her skin, fairly\n",
      "luminous in the sunlight. He fancied they would drift into matrimony;\n",
      "and that she appeared to be as indifferent and passionless as she was\n",
      "handsome and clever but the better suited his present mood. His love for\n",
      "Mrs. Kaye had died a sudden and violent death, but it had left him\n",
      "callous, somewhat contemptuous of the charms of woman. He doubted if his\n",
      "heart would ever beat high in his breast again, but in the course of\n",
      "events he should need a partner, and Isabel seemed to him fashioned to\n",
      "be the helpmate of a busy and ambitious statesman.\n",
      "But all he said was: \"You have a little freckle on your nose. I saw it\n",
      "come.\"\n",
      "Isabel shrugged her shoulders and sniffed. He lost interest in her for\n",
      "the moment, for he distrusted a woman without vanity. He knew girls too\n",
      "little to suspect that the most business-like were often smitten with a\n",
      "desire to pose; and were as likely to forget the pose of to-day in the\n",
      "naturalness of to-morrow. Secretly, Isabel was grievously afflicted at\n",
      "the thought of the freckle, and did not speak for some time, recalling\n",
      "the antidotes of her early girlhood, when she and Anabel Leslie\n",
      "experimented in secret with various beauty recipes cut from the\n",
      "newspapers. She smiled as she recalled that Anabel, who had pretty\n",
      "golden hair, had washed it with lye to acquire a reddish tinge, and been\n",
      "forced to retire for a month; and a semi-tragic experience of her\n",
      "own--smothered from crown to toe in a blanket taking a hot-air bath for\n",
      "the benefit of her complexion, the spirit lamp, in a wash-basin under\n",
      "the chair, exploded, and there was one interminable moment of panic, and\n",
      "several days of discomfort. She quite forgot her companion in these\n",
      "lighter reminiscences of a period that seemed far more than ten years\n",
      "agone.\n",
      "Gwynne had discovered at Capheaton that one of his cousin's charms was\n",
      "her absence of effort in conversation and a corresponding indifference\n",
      "to effort in others. They did not exchange a syllable as they sped up\n",
      "the wider expanse of the bay east of the Islands, and he watched the\n",
      "hills and mountains close on his left, with their bright little towns\n",
      "and sombre depths of forest. Many of the rounded cones of the foothills\n",
      "were bare, and so was the rocky crest of Tamalpais, but the old redwoods\n",
      "still held triumphant possession of several of the slopes and all of the\n",
      "canyons. Here and there factories and warehouses marred the almost\n",
      "primeval beauty of the scene, but to-day at least there was no smoke to\n",
      "cobweb the radiant sky. Even the Chinese shrimp-pickers were lounging on\n",
      "the beach before their little shack village.\n",
      "They passed the last of the towns. Towers and sharp roofs rose above the\n",
      "mass of cultivated trees in some private park; the trees a motley\n",
      "collection of pines and palms, eucalyptus and oak, madrono, laurel,\n",
      "locust, and acacia. The gardens were full of children and birds. On the\n",
      "roads horses in old-fashioned buggies danced at automobiles whizzing by.\n",
      "In the yachts even the men had laid aside their keen anxious look--as\n",
      "peculiar to the young San Franciscan of business as to the New-Yorker or\n",
      "Westerner--and were bent upon absolute relaxation for the day. One\n",
      "millionaire was alone in his big luxurious launch, a broad grin on his\n",
      "homely ingenuous countenance, and even his mouth open to inhale the\n",
      "clean and sparkling air. His hands were clasped on his curves.\n",
      "\"He inherited,\" said Isabel, in reply to Gwynne's comment that he did\n",
      "not look as if he ever expended his energies in the piling of dollars.\n",
      "\"And he doesn't want any more. But they all look well enough. It is not\n",
      "only the climate but the cooking.\"\n",
      "They left San Francisco Bay and Isabel steered more carefully: the\n",
      "channel in the Bay of San Pablo is narrow and the current treacherous.\n",
      "When they reached the drawbridge they were not only alone on the wide\n",
      "silvery expanse of water, but there was scarcely a country-house to\n",
      "break the wild loneliness of mountain and canyon. After they entered\n",
      "Rosewater Creek the mountains with their broken and multiplying ridges\n",
      "were more imposing still, and before long another range began to taper\n",
      "northward on the opposite shore. They were in the great tidal marsh now,\n",
      "green, where all the rest of the world was burnt and dry. At times the\n",
      "creek was as wide as an ordinary river, at others so contracted that one\n",
      "could gather grass on either side. Isabel told Gwynne to \"watch out for\n",
      "other boats,\" for the creek wound and twisted and doubled like a mammoth\n",
      "brown snake into an infinite perspective, broken here and there by\n",
      "sailing boats that had the effect of skimming the land. It was a scene\n",
      "reminiscent of Holland, but far more beautiful, with the wild primeval\n",
      "character of the landscape and the grandeur of the mountains.\n",
      "Isabel indicated an island well out in the marsh. It was crowned with a\n",
      "white house shaded by many trees. Men in duck trousers, and coatless,\n",
      "were lounging in the shade.\n",
      "\"That is a country club,\" she said. \"Tom Colton will put you up. But if\n",
      "you are still disinclined to sociabilities you can shoot all the ducks\n",
      "you want on my place.\"\n",
      "\"Shoot what?\"\n",
      "\"Best duck-shooting in the world is out here--canvas-back, teal, English\n",
      "widgeon--fancy your not knowing that. It begins on the fifteenth of\n",
      "October. I have not rented my marsh-lands this year, and intend to shoot\n",
      "ducks for the market. You can help me and we'll go halves.\"\n",
      "Gwynne's eyes were sparkling. He had expected to kill his bear and deer,\n",
      "but any variety of sport new or old gave him joy. Isabel pointed to many\n",
      "little shanties on the edge of the marsh.\n",
      "\"The more enthusiastic sit in those and wait for the tide to come back.\n",
      "I avoid being left high and dry, for if the ducks go elsewhere it is\n",
      "rather a bore.\"\n",
      "The mountains on the left diminished in height, turned off abruptly to\n",
      "the northwest, following the coast line. Those on the right took form in\n",
      "the pink mist that enveloped them, for the sun had set. All the lower\n",
      "sky was pink, melting imperceptibly into the still pale blue of day. Far\n",
      "to the north other mountains seemed suddenly to heave from the level,\n",
      "villages appeared, with great stretches of farming land between. Then\n",
      "the glow faded into the gray of twilight and the vast landscape took on\n",
      "a sudden aspect of desolation; as of a country stranded, forgotten,\n",
      "with a heap of stones here and there to mark some ancient civilization.\n",
      "\"There is Rosewater--over there where the lights are coming out; and\n",
      "here we are,\" said Isabel.\n",
      "Gwynne turned with a start and found that Isabel had run her launch up\n",
      "to a little pier. Behind it was a cluster of low hills set with narrow\n",
      "fields and tiny white houses. In the foreground was a large house of two\n",
      "stories and no architecture whatever, although the roof was mercifully\n",
      "flat. It was painted white and surrounded by a broad veranda. The garden\n",
      "was full of bare rosebushes and blooming chrysanthemums, but save for\n",
      "two mournful eucalypti and a naked acacia, there was not a tree in\n",
      "sight. Just behind were many out-buildings, stark and white.\n",
      "\"Is this where you live?\" asked Gwynne, wonderingly. He had vaguely\n",
      "pictured her in a romantic setting, a bit of California epitomized.\n",
      "\"It was like Uncle Hiram to sell off the prettiest parts, but I don't\n",
      "bother about anything I can't help, and I have a lovely view opposite.\n",
      "Where is that boy?\" She raised her voice and called, \"Chuma! Chuma!\" and\n",
      "in a moment a Japanese boy came running down to the pier.\n",
      "\"The two men spend Sunday in Rosewater, but I have trained my Jap to do\n",
      "a little of everything,\" said Isabel, as they walked up to the house.\n",
      "\"He is one of the willing sort; most are not. Chuma is my cook and\n",
      "butler and chambermaid--\"\n",
      "\"Do you mean that you live here without any other woman?\"\n",
      "\"Why not? No girl would stay in this lonely place. I should have to send\n",
      "her in to Rosewater every night and get a second girl to keep her\n",
      "company. Mac--who was with Uncle Hiram before I was born--sleeps in the\n",
      "house. It was a hotel forty years ago, by-the-way, and is still known as\n",
      "Old Inn. That was in the days of picturesque ruffianism, and there are\n",
      "terrible stories about the house, but no ghosts.\"\n",
      "It had been decided that Gwynne should dine with Isabel and spend the\n",
      "night at the hotel in Rosewater. Isabel had telephoned to her patient\n",
      "Jap, and there was a log fire in the \"parlor\"--now transformed into a\n",
      "comfortable living-room. Gwynne looked about him with considerable\n",
      "curiosity while Isabel was up-stairs dressing. The walls were \"ceiled\"\n",
      "with redwood and hung with the photographs she had accumulated in her\n",
      "travels, a motley collection of many climes, from the snows of the Alps\n",
      "to the patios of Seville; all, she had informed him, with a personal\n",
      "association: \"she was no photograph fiend.\" Several artist's sketches\n",
      "arrested her guest's attention and he wondered what her life in Paris\n",
      "had been. He fancied that her three years abroad were full of curious\n",
      "chapters, most of them untold; but although she mystified him he could\n",
      "not associate her with license of any sort. There was even a hint of\n",
      "austerity about her, as if she drew strength from her Puritan\n",
      "forefathers.\n",
      "It was patent, however, that she felt herself entitled to physical\n",
      "comforts after the labors of her day. There were half a dozen\n",
      "easy-chairs and a big divan covered with cushions. The carpet and\n",
      "cushions were red, but although the room was delightfully comfortable\n",
      "and homelike it might have been a bachelor's, so entirely were lacking\n",
      "all the little devices of femininity. The only ornaments in the room\n",
      "were an odd assortment of Tyrolese pipes and Indian baskets. On a shelf\n",
      "above the divan, however, were many books, and Gwynne ran his eye over\n",
      "them. They included masterpieces of the modern Russian, German, French,\n",
      "and Italian schools; only three or four volumes of English criticism. A\n",
      "set of shelves opposite was filled with the standard English and\n",
      "American histories, essays, and novels, many of them old and bound in\n",
      "calf. The upper shelf was devoted entirely to the Russian novelists, and\n",
      "the bindings were new.\n",
      "When Isabel came down, looking very pretty in a blue evening frock,\n",
      "simple enough to make her guest feel at ease in his travelling-clothes,\n",
      "but carefully selected with an eye to effect, she sent him up to her\n",
      "room to make his own simple toilet.\n",
      "\"I suppose I should furnish a spare room,\" she remarked. \"But if I did I\n",
      "should have Paula--my adopted sister--and her family here whenever they\n",
      "happened to want to come, which would be always when I didn't want them.\n",
      "But you won't mind.\"\n",
      "Gwynne made a wry face as he sat down before the dressing-table that he\n",
      "might reflect his visage while he brushed his hair. Nevertheless, he\n",
      "cast about a curious and apologetic eye, in the belief that a woman's\n",
      "bedroom must reveal some secret of her personality. This bedroom was so\n",
      "simple and girlish that it gave him a vague sense of pleasure. The\n",
      "windows and dressing-table were covered with white muslin, and there was\n",
      "a canopy of the same above the little brass bedstead. The flounces were\n",
      "so full and fluffy that he held his knees back nervously lest he should\n",
      "disturb a puff. There was no other furniture in the room but two\n",
      "rocking-chairs, and the only color was in the blue Japanese rugs\n",
      "scattered over the white matting, and in two immense bows above the\n",
      "dressing-table and bed. He decided, as he ran down the stairs to the\n",
      "warm room below, that she understood both taste and comfort, and looked\n",
      "forward to his own lonely ranch-house with more equanimity than when he\n",
      "had paid the bill.\n",
      "IV\n",
      "There were two miles between Rosewater and Old Inn, but although Isabel\n",
      "rode briskly and was sensible as ever of the keen buoyant quality of the\n",
      "morning air that so often filled her with a pagan indifference to the\n",
      "human side of life, her thoughts were with the pleasant evening by her\n",
      "fireside, the supper in the low raftered room which once had been the\n",
      "office of the hotel--a supper of fried chicken, transparent asparagus,\n",
      "and soda biscuit, which Gwynne had disposed of with a school-boy's\n",
      "enthusiasm--the hundred and one impersonal topics they had discussed in\n",
      "a cloud of smoke before the logs, until Abe, the second hired man--who\n",
      "was to drive Gwynne in to Rosewater--had opened the kitchen door three\n",
      "times and coughed. Not since Isabel's return to California had she sat\n",
      "at a fireside and talked to anybody; nor, indeed, with the exception of\n",
      "her father in his lucid intervals, and her uncle in his rare moments of\n",
      "expansion, had she ever talked with any one that covered the large range\n",
      "of her own interests. Gwynne had snapped the lock on his unquiet spirit,\n",
      "but in that comfortable domestic environment, half lying in an\n",
      "easy-chair, with his gaze travelling indolently between the fire and the\n",
      "animated face of his cousin, he had talked of her favorite books and\n",
      "told her much of lands she had never visited. He had transferred himself\n",
      "to the buggy with a grumble of disgust, and begged her to come for him\n",
      "early in the morning. He refused to pay his first visit to his ranch\n",
      "without her; and she had promised that Abe should go early for his\n",
      "saddle-horse and meet her at the hotel.\n",
      "Pleasurable as the evening had been, Isabel was not in a sentimental\n",
      "frame of mind; she was stirred at the prospect of a companion, and\n",
      "wondered that she had been content in her solitude so long. Solitude and\n",
      "complete liberty might be indispensable elements in her ideal of mortal\n",
      "existence, but desultory companionship might be as necessary to\n",
      "intensify them.\n",
      "It was nearly a year since her return, and outside of the bank parlor\n",
      "and Judge Leslie's office, she had held naught but business converse\n",
      "with any man. Nor with any woman. Although Rosewater society offered her\n",
      "nothing and she was glad to live out of town, still she liked her old\n",
      "school friends and had expected them to call on her. But weeks had\n",
      "passed and not one of them had paid her the mere civilities. She met\n",
      "them sometimes on Saturday afternoons, when all the world of Rosewater\n",
      "shopped on Main Street, and they invariably greeted her with effusion,\n",
      "and assured her they were \"going out soon.\" Finally, busy and absorbed\n",
      "as she was, she fell a prey to curiosity. She knew that the young men\n",
      "had always rather feared her, as she had a forbidding reputation in the\n",
      "way of \"bookishness\"; and as most of them had either left Rosewater or\n",
      "married, in the four years of her absence, she had expected nothing from\n",
      "them. But the girls? The young married women, who had been her comrades\n",
      "at the High School? Did they resent her three years abroad and the sense\n",
      "of superiority implied? It was patent from their manner that they\n",
      "resented nothing. Did they disapprove of her becoming so energetic a\n",
      "business woman? It was true that the girls of California's country\n",
      "towns, except when forced by poverty to work, were the laziest mortals\n",
      "on earth. But nothing could exceed their good-nature and entire\n",
      "indifference. Isabel might have started a race-track or opened a\n",
      "livery-stable and they would have vaguely admired, and been thankful\n",
      "that themselves were as God made them. Her friend Anabel Colton was in\n",
      "the south with an ailing child, and Mrs. Leslie was with her, or the\n",
      "problem would have been quickly solved.\n",
      "One morning she met the beauty of Rosewater on Main Street, Miss Dolly\n",
      "Boutts, a girl who had been half grown when she left, but one of her own\n",
      "rapturous admirers. Main Street was crowded, but Miss Boutts rushed up\n",
      "and kissed her, protesting that she had been trying for two months to\n",
      "get out to see her. Isabel guided her firmly to an ice-cream table in\n",
      "the candy store, and while Miss Boutts, who was a superb specimen of\n",
      "animal beauty with a corresponding appetite, disposed of two saucers of\n",
      "the delectable and a plate of cakes, Isabel dived to the heart of the\n",
      "mystery.\n",
      "She began by dilating upon her pleasure in being home again, and then\n",
      "congratulated her handsome friend, with a touch of sarcasm, upon the\n",
      "overwhelming gayeties of Rosewater.\n",
      "Miss Boutts stared. \"Gayeties?\" said she.\n",
      "\"What else? I never knew people so absorbed, although I fail to see why\n",
      "I should be wholly excluded. Or have the fashions changed, and was I\n",
      "expected to call first--\"\n",
      "Miss Boutts, who was not particularly quick of apprehension, here threw\n",
      "back her head and gave a musical laugh, which was out of tune with her\n",
      "drawling nasal voice and abundant slang.\n",
      "\"You innocent!\" she cried. \"Where have you been? I suppose you have been\n",
      "imagining us at dances and dinners and teas and things. Why, we have\n",
      "only danced twice in two whole years. It's cards, my dear. We are card\n",
      "mad, the whole bunch of us, old and young, women and girls. Mrs. Leslie\n",
      "and Anabel Colton are about the only exceptions, at least in our set.\n",
      "But I fancy the whole town has got it. We play morning, noon, and\n",
      "night--literally. Those who have no servants--and that question gets\n",
      "worse instead of better--don't make their beds for days, and their\n",
      "husbands get dinner at any old hour. Those who have a servant or two\n",
      "belong to six clubs at least. I belong to every one of them, and two\n",
      "meet in the morning.\"\n",
      "It had been Isabel's turn to stare. The older people had always played\n",
      "bezique or whist, but rather somnolently of an evening. She wondered if\n",
      "the old gambling spirit had broken out again, and asked if they were\n",
      "playing poker or monte. Miss Boutts looked at her with positive scorn.\n",
      "\"You girls that go to Europe and stay there too long get fearfully\n",
      "behind things. Poker! Monte! We play bridge and five hundred.\" Then her\n",
      "genuine affection for Isabel overcame her contempt. \"We have spoken\n",
      "often of asking you to join the clubs,\" she added, sweetly. \"But there\n",
      "isn't a vacancy at present.\"\n",
      "\"I couldn't think of it. Chickens and cards don't rhyme. What do you\n",
      "play for--money?\"\n",
      "\"No!\" The scorn returned to her voice. \"We are still too provincial for\n",
      "that. San Francisco is ahead of us there. We don't even have real big\n",
      "prizes--just a dinky little spoon sitting up on the mantel-piece to\n",
      "excite us as if it was a tiara. I've won a whole bunch of them. They're\n",
      "better than nothing and mean a lot of fun. I'm as proud as punch of\n",
      "them.\"\n",
      "\"And the men?\" asked Isabel. Did they play, too? Miss Boutts replied\n",
      "that they were too busy in the daytime, but were asked once a week to a\n",
      "\"bang-up\" affair. Their other evenings they spent at the lodges--\"or any\n",
      "old place,\" added Miss Boutts, who had no brothers, and a very busy\n",
      "father. When Isabel asked her if she had not the natural yearning of her\n",
      "age and sex for beaux, she shrugged her shoulders and replied:\n",
      "\"Rather. But where are you going to find them here? Pa won't live in the\n",
      "city, and all the young men run away. Once in a while I visit in San\n",
      "Francisco, and we go down to all the new plays, so I suppose I'll meet\n",
      "my fate in time. Meanwhile, as there's nothing doing in that line here,\n",
      "cards are a mighty fine substitute for beaux, and no mistake.\"\n",
      "Isabel had been glad to be rid of her, and of her other old friends, who\n",
      "did call in due course. Anabel had not returned and was the worst of\n",
      "correspondents. So it had fallen out that she had held no real converse\n",
      "with youth until Gwynne's advent, and she accepted it with delight, and\n",
      "shook her head with young triumph in being able to interest him--or in\n",
      "joy of the sparkling air; she hardly knew which.\n",
      "*       *       *       *       *\n",
      "As Gwynne left his room the Japanese \"chambermaid,\" who had been about\n",
      "to knock, informed him that Miss Otis awaited him below. He ran\n",
      "down-stairs and found her still on her horse. Abe held another horse by\n",
      "the bridle.\n",
      "\"It is nine o'clock--\" began Isabel, but Gwynne interrupted her, rarely\n",
      "apologetic.\n",
      "\"I hardly slept. There was such an infernal racket. A theatrical\n",
      "troupe--\"\n",
      "\"There generally is. How do you like your horse?\"\n",
      "Gwynne examined the horse, and was good enough to remark that it was a\n",
      "credit to California. Then he added: \"It did not occur to me last\n",
      "night--my luggage is expressed to the ranch and I haven't my\n",
      "riding-togs--\" Then he reddened at Isabel's gay laugh and Abe's\n",
      "suppressed smile.\n",
      "\"Oh, well,\" said Isabel, as she sprang from her horse. \"The bloods will\n",
      "be too busy to notice as we ride down Main Street, and after that it\n",
      "won't matter.\"\n",
      "She went with him into the dining-room of the hotel, a room scrupulously\n",
      "clean, but with no attempt at decoration beyond the various\n",
      "advertisements of beer on the white walls. There was a long table down\n",
      "the middle of the room and a great many small ones. Most of the latter\n",
      "were empty, although two beside the door were covered with steaks and\n",
      "eggs and coffee and rolls. One man, who had evidently finished, had\n",
      "swung his chair about, tipped it against the wall, and was addressing a\n",
      "political monologue to his toothpick.\n",
      "Gwynne led Isabel to a table in a corner by a window, and indicated the\n",
      "company occupying more than half of the long table.\n",
      "\"'Busted,' was the word they used, and I cannot think of a better one to\n",
      "describe them. I talked with the men in the bar, and later wandered into\n",
      "the parlor where the women were, some tearful, others indignant. One\n",
      "had an infant, and there were several small children running about,\n",
      "although it was midnight. The soubrette was chewing gum and\n",
      "anathematizing Rosewater as the 'jayest town on the slope,' and others\n",
      "were calling for the blood of the manager, who had absconded with the\n",
      "receipts of an unprofitable week. They interested me, as all your weird\n",
      "specimens do, and I found them a surprisingly decent lot, considering\n",
      "that it is the cheapest sort of a vaudeville troupe. That poor little\n",
      "woman with the red eyes and the parti-colored hair is the mother of the\n",
      "infant. I saw one of the children carrying it about the hall as I left\n",
      "my room. She wears spangled tights--she told me with a lively regret at\n",
      "the prospect of pawning them--and shoots balls from the head of that\n",
      "young man that looks like a parson. And the soubrette--all my ideals are\n",
      "shattered! Look at her.\"\n",
      "The soubrette had a lank young body neatly attired in a store suit and\n",
      "shirt-waist. Her face was sallow and her black hair as lank as her body,\n",
      "but her eyes were keen and bright, and she was indisputably respectable.\n",
      "She was drinking her coffee with both elbows on the table and listening\n",
      "with a sort of indifferent sympathy to an elderly untidy woman who was\n",
      "sniffling.\n",
      "\"Drop it,\" she shot out, finally. \"'Tain't worth it. The landlord's\n",
      "given us a free breakfast, anyhow, and it's more'n most of 'em does.\n",
      "We'll get back to 'Frisco somehow, and will run into Jake first thing.\n",
      "I'll give him a slice of my mind right in the thickest of the\n",
      "Tenderloin. You just shut up and be thankful you ain't got no kids.\"\n",
      "\"She is positively discouraging,\" said Gwynne, as he attacked his\n",
      "excellent breakfast. \"I thought that the frozen surface of the American\n",
      "woman thawed on the stratum soubrette.\"\n",
      "\"The class is not always remarkable for its asceticism,\" said Isabel,\n",
      "dryly. \"I often lunch here, and see many varieties. The leading lady is\n",
      "generally a large voluptuous person with a head like a hay-stack seen\n",
      "through the wrong end of an opera-glass, and some of the soubrettes are\n",
      "all hats and eyes and wriggling grace. The men are what we call 'tough,'\n",
      "which is not exactly what you mean by 'toff.' Occasionally, however,\n",
      "there are the most respectable family parties, including the children\n",
      "whom they won't be parted from. We have three places of amusement,\n",
      "including quite a fine opera-house, so they do very well, as a rule. Was\n",
      "it your sympathy that kept you awake?\"\n",
      "\"I am not an ass. But they were in and out of one another's rooms all\n",
      "night, and of course the baby cried. Then my room was over the\n",
      "bar--well, what will you? Such is life. I am sorry you cannot eat\n",
      "another breakfast. This seems to be the land of good cooking. If I did\n",
      "not scorn to be unoriginal I should dilate upon the pie and doughnuts I\n",
      "had for breakfast on the other side of your continent.\"\n",
      "He seemed still light of heart at the sudden end to his wanderings and\n",
      "isolation, and they forgot the troupe and chatted about his ranch. He\n",
      "had much to ask and his sponsor more to tell.\n",
      "The theatrical party appeared to finish their breakfast simultaneously.\n",
      "Three, including the soubrette, reached under the table, dislodged the\n",
      "morsel of gum they had mechanically attached to the under side of the\n",
      "board, closed on it with a snap, and filed out. Most of them looked\n",
      "quite cheerful. Several bowed to Gwynne. The soubrette gave him a\n",
      "haughty suspicious nod.\n",
      "\"She looked at me like that last night,\" said Gwynne, complainingly.\n",
      "\"What designs does she attribute to me? I never treated any one with\n",
      "more respect.\"\n",
      "\"They are all like that when they are respectable. Their fierce\n",
      "Americanism resents any hint of patronage. Later on they invite it. You\n",
      "will find these waitresses--the class, as a rule, is thoroughly\n",
      "decent--much the same in manner.\"\n",
      "Two girls, white clad, their extended arms loaded with dishes, were\n",
      "stalking about the room, anaemic, disdainful. A portly woman, whom Isabel\n",
      "knew to be the mother of a brood, was far more anxious to please. She\n",
      "came up to the table in the corner and asked Gwynne affably if his\n",
      "coffee was \"all right\" and if he was a stranger in \"these parts.\" He was\n",
      "under Isabel's amused eye, but he acquitted himself with credit; and\n",
      "when he rose from the table she thanked him indifferently for his tip,\n",
      "but her eyes glowed softly. It was rarely thought worth while to tip a\n",
      "mere waitress.\n",
      "V\n",
      "As they rode slowly down the hill towards Main Street Gwynne examined\n",
      "his cousin from head to foot, but, he prided himself, out of the corner\n",
      "of his eye. She wore a dust-colored habit with divided skirt, and a soft\n",
      "felt hat and gloves of the same shade. Her horse was a very light\n",
      "chestnut, and he was obliged to confess that the effect was harmonious,\n",
      "although this Western style of riding by no means pleased his fastidious\n",
      "taste.\n",
      "Isabel shot him an amused glance. \"You don't approve of women riding\n",
      "astride,\" she said. \"We invented it; although it is now the fashion in\n",
      "many other parts of America. Necessity is the mother of most fashions.\n",
      "Wait till you see our mountain roads. They are a disgrace to\n",
      "civilization--so broken and narrow that even in summer it is dangerous\n",
      "for a woman to ride a side-saddle, and in winter impossible. I have\n",
      "forgotten how, and that is the reason I never rode in England.... Here\n",
      "is the centre of your existence for several years to come. Main Street\n",
      "is to this section of the country what Wall Street is to the United\n",
      "States.\"\n",
      "They had entered a street that turned abruptly in from the country a\n",
      "block below them, and rose gently for several hundred yards, when it\n",
      "straggled unevenly along a higher level, to melt into the older\n",
      "residence district and then out into the open country again. There was\n",
      "nothing quite like this Main Street in California. At its southern end\n",
      "was a long double hitching-rail--as old as the State--already flanked by\n",
      "several dusty wagons and big strong horses. The long unbroken block had\n",
      "as many and as various stores as are generally spread over the entire\n",
      "area of a town. Jammed against one another like cabins opening out of a\n",
      "steamer's gangway, and yet of no mean size, were banks and saloons;\n",
      "stores for chicken feed, groceries, fruit, candy, jewelry, clothing,\n",
      "hats, fancy goods, stationery; and five drug stores with tiled floors.\n",
      "Many of the windows made a brave display that would not have disgraced\n",
      "San Francisco. The entire west pavement was roofed, making a promenade\n",
      "like a ship's deck against rain or the severities of summer; and from\n",
      "this roof depended an extraordinary number of signs, often eccentric of\n",
      "color and design. Above the buildings of the opposite side of the street\n",
      "rose the spars of several fishing-boats; the creek finished at\n",
      "Rosewater. Gwynne glanced about him with an interest that nothing else\n",
      "Californian save the Mission and San Francisco had inspired. Here was a\n",
      "bit of a civilization of a building era, that was almost old, everything\n",
      "being relative. At all events it was old-fashioned. It was thoroughly\n",
      "countrified and yet suggestive of the concentrated activities of a city.\n",
      "Isabel, after leaving the hotel had made a detour, giving him a brief\n",
      "glimpse of the town. On the higher streets--Rosewater lay on a cluster\n",
      "of gentle hills--between Main Street and the \"residence\" district, he\n",
      "had noticed several modern buildings of brick or stone: offices,\n",
      "churches, school-houses, a solid little opera-house of colonial design,\n",
      "a fine City Hall, and one of those forlorn \"Carnegie Libraries\" in a\n",
      "state of arrested development for want of funds, but with an imposing\n",
      "facade and the name of the \"donor\" conspicuously advertised. All this\n",
      "had interested him little, although he had thought the town on its\n",
      "slopes looked very pretty and quiet; but this----the word \"pioneer\"\n",
      "suddenly came to him, and he looked up and down with a keenness of\n",
      "interest that was almost like a reviving memory. This beyond question\n",
      "was a remnant of the old thing, and here, no doubt, the\n",
      "great-grandfather whose first name he had forgotten, had been a familiar\n",
      "sight; his fortune and enterprise had helped to lay the very foundations\n",
      "of this landmark of a wild and stirring time.----Then they rode past a\n",
      "square park high on a terrace, walled up with stone most modernly, the\n",
      "green shaded with pines and palms, acacia and oaks; and the dream\n",
      "passed. At the same moment he became aware that his partner was talking.\n",
      "\"Rosewater is the financial and trading centre of an immense farming\n",
      "district. There are four banks, as solid as the best in the world. Three\n",
      "are as old as American California. The farmers come in daily for feed\n",
      "and supplies, the chicken-ranchers with their produce for the San\n",
      "Francisco buyers, and eggs for the great hatcheries. Many, like myself,\n",
      "find the last less trouble and expense than bothering with incubators.\n",
      "Something like four thousand dollars change hands daily in Rosewater,\n",
      "and it has less than five thousand inhabitants.\"\n",
      "Having parted with her information she relapsed into silence, and, the\n",
      "town lying behind them, he transferred his attention to her. She looked\n",
      "severe, remote again, and he wondered if she would grow quite hard and\n",
      "business-like in time. In the hotel office as he paid his bill he had\n",
      "overheard one man say to another that she was \"as good as the best, and\n",
      "no man could get ahead of her.\" In this sexless get-up and with her\n",
      "features set she looked hardly a woman. She certainly had capacities for\n",
      "good-fellowship, and yesterday she had been almost tender. He had just\n",
      "decided that he would as soon marry a portrait of George Washington,\n",
      "when, in response to a light call behind them, Isabel wheeled about with\n",
      "the pink in her cheeks and eyes wide with pleasure. She galloped back to\n",
      "an approaching buggy, in which there was an extremely pretty\n",
      "golden-haired young woman, and as she and Isabel simultaneously alighted\n",
      "and flew into each other's arms, Gwynne also descended, prepared to\n",
      "raise his hat when his existence was recognized. For some moments the\n",
      "girls talked a rapid duet, then Isabel turned suddenly and beckoned.\n",
      "\"This is my oldest friend, Anabel--Mrs. Tom Colton,\" she said,\n",
      "apologetically. \"She only returned last night--just caught sight of us,\n",
      "and followed.\"\n",
      "Gwynne's disapproval vanished as he shook hands with the blooming young\n",
      "matron and met her bright laughing eyes. She was a small imposing\n",
      "creature and received him in quite the grand manner. Her accent of\n",
      "America was as slight as Isabel's, and she used no slang. There was\n",
      "about her something of the primness that characterizes American women in\n",
      "the smaller towns, but her simple linen frock had been cut by a master,\n",
      "and she looked so warm, so womanly, so hospitable as she welcomed Gwynne\n",
      "to Rosewater, that he liked her more spontaneously than he had liked\n",
      "anybody since he crossed the Atlantic, and was almost enthusiastic as he\n",
      "rode on with Isabel.\n",
      "\"Anabel is a perfect dear,\" said his companion, whose eyes and cheeks\n",
      "were still glowing, and who looked like a mere girl. \"I am much fonder\n",
      "of her than I am of Paula, although we haven't a thing in common. She\n",
      "was domestic and wild about children before she was done with dolls. Of\n",
      "course she married at once. When we were at the High School together she\n",
      "regarded my ambition to be first as a standing joke, and has never read\n",
      "anything heavier than a classic novel in her life. Why I am so fond of\n",
      "her I can't say, unless it is that she is absolutely genuine, and that\n",
      "counts more in the long-run than anything else. Besides, she was my\n",
      "first friend when I came here as a little girl. Her mother--Mrs.\n",
      "Leslie--belongs to one of the old San Francisco families, and had always\n",
      "known my mother. I love her as much as ever, but I am bound to confess\n",
      "that I have missed her little. I suppose complete happiness comes when\n",
      "you miss nobody.\"\n",
      "They rode on in silence, for the heat was increasing and the dust lay\n",
      "thick on the road and swirled about their heads. There had been no rain\n",
      "since March, and the sea that sent its daily fogs and breezes to cool\n",
      "San Francisco and the towns about the bay was forty miles from\n",
      "Rosewater.\n",
      "\"Never mind,\" said Isabel, as Gwynne mopped his brow for the third time\n",
      "and ostentatiously rubbed his face. \"The nights are cool and the hot\n",
      "weather will soon moderate down into the mellowness of October. When the\n",
      "rains come--well it is a toss up, which is worse--the dust or the mud.\"\n",
      "\"Heavens knows what we have swallowed,\" muttered Gwynne, who had served\n",
      "on sanitary boards and heard much talk of germs. But Isabel only laughed\n",
      "and told him to go to Anabel, who had a nostrum for every ill. A moment\n",
      "later the road led up a hill-side, and at the summit she caught his\n",
      "bridle and reined in.\n",
      "\"I brought you this roundabout way on purpose,\" she said. \"Is it not\n",
      "what the poet would call a fair domain?\"\n",
      "Below them was a vast flat expanse bounded opposite by a mountain chain,\n",
      "that rose abruptly from the level, breaking into much irregularity of\n",
      "surface above, but all its hollows blurred with woods. Beyond a dip\n",
      "rose, far in the distance, a huge crouching formidable mass--St. Helena,\n",
      "named after a Russian princess, the wife of the last of the Russian\n",
      "governors of northern California. On the plain were golden fields,\n",
      "orchards, compact masses of the eucalyptus-tree planted as shelters for\n",
      "the cattle in time of storm or unbearable heat. Many cattle were roaming\n",
      "about; on the grazing land in the far distance towards the town of St.\n",
      "Peter--a mere white cluster in the north at the base of the range--were\n",
      "the horses. Over the mountains lay a shimmering haze, blue or pink; it\n",
      "was difficult to define whether the colors flowed through each other or\n",
      "subtly united.\n",
      "\"It is all yours,\" added Isabel, emerging from the role of the mere\n",
      "cicerone. \"Are you not proud of it?\"\n",
      "Gwynne did in truth dilate, but hastily assured himself that it was at\n",
      "the beauty of his estate, not at its paltry nineteen thousand acres. Had\n",
      "he not shot over many an estate as large? Had not his grandfather come\n",
      "into four times that number? True, most of them had not been entailed,\n",
      "and this at least was his, his own. He quite realized it for the first\n",
      "time; even as a source of income he had barely given it a thought; even\n",
      "after Isabel's descriptions he had never exerted himself to picture it.\n",
      "As a resource in his crisis it was all very well, but not worth while\n",
      "shaping into concrete form until he could avoid it no longer.\n",
      "But now, as he gazed down and over the great beautiful expanse--for even\n",
      "the mountain-side and much beyond was his--he felt a sudden passionate\n",
      "gratitude to that Otis whose first name he had forgotten, pride fairly\n",
      "invaded his chest; then, as he realized that it was visibly swelling\n",
      "under Isabel's intent gaze, he blushed, laughed confusedly, turned away\n",
      "his head. But his annoyance was routed by a speechless amazement, for\n",
      "Isabel suddenly flung both arms round his neck and gave him a hearty\n",
      "kiss.\n",
      "\"There!\" she exclaimed. \"I never really liked you before, though I never\n",
      "denied you were interesting enough. Men are nothing but overgrown boys,\n",
      "only some are nice and some are not. You are. I'll really adopt you now,\n",
      "instead of merely doing my bounden duty. Now look at those mountains in\n",
      "the south.\"\n",
      "More disturbed than he would have believed possible at the young warmth\n",
      "and magnetism of her embrace--although it was disconcertingly evident\n",
      "that she would have kissed a small boy in precisely the same manner--he\n",
      "composed his features to indifference and followed the motion of her\n",
      "whip.\n",
      "In the dim perspective of the south she indicated Tamalpais and Monte\n",
      "Diablo opposite, vague dim blue masses behind San Francisco. \"Monte\n",
      "Diablo and St. Helena are both old volcanoes,\" she continued. \"I never\n",
      "say dead volcanoes after the history and performances of Vesuvius and\n",
      "Pelee. I wish one of our volcanoes would liven up. We might have fewer\n",
      "earthquakes--although, to be sure, ours are supposed to be caused by\n",
      "faulting--in so far as they know anything about it.\"\n",
      "\"Do you think of nothing but earthquakes out here? You have made at\n",
      "least three casual allusions since we met twenty-four hours ago, and in\n",
      "southern California they are a part of every tradition.\"\n",
      "\"If you had been brought up on earthquakes they would never be far from\n",
      "your own mind. There is a theory that the reason for Californians taking\n",
      "everything as it comes with a happy-go-lucky philosophy, lies in the\n",
      "electrical air and the eight months of sunshine; but I believe it is due\n",
      "even more to the earthquakes. If we can stand those we can stand\n",
      "anything. It is in tune with the old gambling spirit that still colors\n",
      "the country; no doubt has kept it alive. We never know what is going to\n",
      "happen next, and we don't care. _Vive la bagatelle._ We have more to be\n",
      "thankful for than the rest of the world, anyhow. Well, let us go down to\n",
      "the house.\"\n",
      "The house with its out-buildings stood below them on a high knoll, three\n",
      "sides surrounded by a grove of white oaks, the other open to the\n",
      "mountains, although the front veranda was shaded by several spreading\n",
      "trees, far apart. The large soft leaves and the pendent moss of the oaks\n",
      "were gray with dust, but the shade was cool and delicious. Down in the\n",
      "valley an old comrade here and there helped to tell the story of the\n",
      "time when all these miles of valley and mountain were unbroken forest,\n",
      "known only to the red man. And that was not a century ago.\n",
      "The house was frankly ugly, like all the farm-houses of its era,\n",
      "although vastly to be preferred to the \"artistic\" structures succeeding\n",
      "them. As the couple gave up their horses to a stately Jap, who had been\n",
      "engaged by Isabel as butler, chambermaid, valet, and footman, and\n",
      "entered the large living-room, Gwynne generously gave voice to his\n",
      "approval. There were books to the ceiling, easy-chairs, the photographs\n",
      "of friends that had decorated his rooms in London and Capheaton. His\n",
      "eyes contracted as he saw a pile of London newspapers on the table, and\n",
      "he turned away hastily and remarked that he was glad the fittings were\n",
      "red, as it would be more companionable in winter; the rest of the year\n",
      "he should live out-of-doors. The veranda, which surrounded the house,\n",
      "was quite wide enough to live on, and below it was a border of garden\n",
      "full of old-fashioned flowers. The bedrooms, gayly furbished with chintz\n",
      "and matting, were up-stairs.\n",
      "\"I didn't think it worth while to furnish a dining-room,\" said Isabel as\n",
      "they returned to the lower floor. \"It has always been the custom to eat\n",
      "at the end of the living-room--when they didn't eat in the kitchen. And\n",
      "what more dreary than to take your meals in a big country dining-room by\n",
      "yourself! All the rooms here are large.\"\n",
      "She took him into the kitchen and introduced him to his cook, a stout\n",
      "Mexican woman, who received him with excessive dignity, and wore nothing\n",
      "but a single calico garment open to the chest. Then they mounted their\n",
      "horses again and Isabel escorted him down to the great hay-barns, the\n",
      "dairy, and cattle-sheds, introducing him to his hired men, who looked\n",
      "him over frankly, but, somewhat to his surprise, addressed him as \"sir.\"\n",
      "He commented upon the unexpected deference as they rode back to the\n",
      "house.\n",
      "\"Oh, these country folk are naturally polite,\" said Isabel, dryly. \"They\n",
      "are not yet entirely corrupted by the yellow press, although independent\n",
      "enough, as you will discover. Tact will manage any one. I have been\n",
      "managing people all my life, and have prepared this force to like you.\n",
      "Now I must be off. I am to lunch with Anabel.\"\n",
      "\"You are not going to leave me!\" cried Gwynne, in dismay.\n",
      "\"The tragic moment must come sooner or later,\" she said, gayly. \"And you\n",
      "have forgotten your mail. It is somewhere under all those newspapers.\n",
      "I'll ride out in a day or two and see how you are getting on.\"\n",
      "She gave him a cavalier little nod, touched her horse with the whip, and\n",
      "a moment later was lost in a cloud of dust. Gwynne, angry and\n",
      "disappointed, looked after her a moment, then shrugged his shoulders and\n",
      "went in to his mail.\n",
      "VI\n",
      "Mrs. Tom Colton lived on one of the higher slopes of Rosewater in a\n",
      "charming little double house all brown shingles and big chimneys.\n",
      "Opposite was the paternal mansion on a high terrace, a modern\n",
      "Renaissance structure, painted white and shaded with gigantic palms and\n",
      "acacias. There was a porte-cochere but no balcony.\n",
      "All the \"residences\" of this quarter were modern and \"artistic,\" even\n",
      "the cottages; it was only on the lower slopes, close to the nucleus of\n",
      "the town, that the many old-fashioned structures were but occasionally\n",
      "thrown out of tune by a pile of shingles and stone. But all had gardens,\n",
      "and there were several squares whence the streets radiated with as\n",
      "puzzling an irregularity as London's own, but set thick with shade trees\n",
      "tropical and boreal. On the high rim of the hills enclosing the town\n",
      "were many small farms, and all were white with the Leghorn that laid the\n",
      "golden eggs. These looked like a light fall of snow on the sunburned\n",
      "hills, and were as refreshing as the garden trees upon which the hose\n",
      "played night and morning.\n",
      "As Isabel left her horse at a livery-stable and walked up the wide clean\n",
      "boulevard towards her friend's house, she met no one on the glaring\n",
      "pavements, although here and there a buggy was hitched, and a patient\n",
      "horse stood with his fore feet on the line of grass beside the\n",
      "concrete, his head under a tree, and his eyes fixed expectantly upon\n",
      "the door of the house. Indeed one might walk here at almost any hour of\n",
      "the day and rarely meet another; all the energies were concentrated in\n",
      "Main Street, although it was the town's standing grievance that it was\n",
      "not the county-seat with a court-house that should make the pretensions\n",
      "of St. Peter ridiculous. No small part of those energies in the business\n",
      "district were devoted to humbling the rival, in the matter of commerce.\n",
      "St. Peter retaliated with the accent of a fierce contempt.\n",
      "\"Chickenville!\" \"The Eggopolis!\" quoth the local wits, and who shall say\n",
      "that the darts did not quiver and sting, although the more flourishing\n",
      "community never lowered its self-satisfied front? Even the rich banker\n",
      "families were not at the trouble to put on airs. They did not possess a\n",
      "handsome turnout between them, and as for dress there were few that did\n",
      "more than keep themselves cool in summer and warm in winter. It was true\n",
      "that Mr. Boutts possessed a runabout automobile in which he bumped his\n",
      "family to San Francisco occasionally, but he was of the newer gentry and\n",
      "owed his social pre-eminence to his wife and pretty daughter, and to his\n",
      "conversion from the Congregational to the Episcopal Church.\n",
      "Isabel, of course, was a conspicuous member of the ancient aristocracy,\n",
      "by virtue of her forefathers having owned half the county when the smoke\n",
      "still rose from the wigwam; and although Mrs. James Otis had maintained\n",
      "a haughty aloofness on her husband's ranch in summer, and later in a\n",
      "Rosewater cottage, her neighbors thought none the less of her for that,\n",
      "and Isabel, after school hours, played with their children. Later, even\n",
      "the transgressions of her father, and her unchaperoned trip to Europe,\n",
      "left her position secure. An Otis was an Otis. _Noblesse oblige._\n",
      "Aristocracies are aristocracies the world over.\n",
      "Mrs. Tom saw Isabel coming and opened the door herself; then as lunch\n",
      "would not be ready for an hour, led her up to her large sunny bedroom,\n",
      "where her three children, pretty fragile creatures in spite of their\n",
      "tan, sweet-fed and spoiled, were playing on the floor. Isabel tossed and\n",
      "kissed them, presenting them with a box of toys she had bought in Main\n",
      "Street. Then she sat down with Anabel in the window to have a long talk.\n",
      "But she quickly discovered that Anabel talked with one wing of her\n",
      "brain, so to speak, and her roving gaze beamed constantly at the noisy\n",
      "brood on the floor. Complacency, maternity, happiness, radiated from all\n",
      "her sweet womanly little person, but in half an hour Isabel was casting\n",
      "about for an excuse to leave directly after luncheon, although she had\n",
      "promised to spend the day. As Anabel babbled on, while embroidering a\n",
      "little frock, relating anecdotes of her marvellous children, commenting\n",
      "upon the increasing extortions of the labor class, the iniquities of\n",
      "servants, the mounting of prices in California, and the shocking mania\n",
      "for cards that possessed Rosewater in common with the rest of the world,\n",
      "there stole over Isabel a feeling of intolerable ennui. She had felt it\n",
      "often enough in her sister's uneven domestic atmosphere, and now and\n",
      "again in more regulated interiors, but never had the wings of her spirit\n",
      "beaten so furiously as in this happy home of the most beloved of her\n",
      "friends. The wave ebbed when the nurse came and carried off the\n",
      "protesting trio, and as she sat with Anabel in the beautiful little\n",
      "dining-room panelled and furnished with redwood, highly polished, the\n",
      "table set with silver and crystal, the dainty meal beyond criticism and\n",
      "served by a noiseless Chinaman, she was able to feel grateful that\n",
      "Anabel was as happy in her way as herself in her own, and praised\n",
      "everything with such warmth that the placid little lady waxed radiant.\n",
      "Mrs. Tom was very golden-haired and blue-eyed and pink and white, but\n",
      "none was further removed from insipidity than she. Her features were\n",
      "strong, particularly her mouth and chin, and she had a repose of manner,\n",
      "a squareness of shoulder, and a serenity of expression that gave her an\n",
      "almost solid appearance. It was patent that she was making a success of\n",
      "her life, and Isabel kissed her at parting with a hearty good-will; but\n",
      "only the excessive dignity inherited from her Spanish ancestors arrested\n",
      "a war-whoop as she almost ran down the hill. She had been detained until\n",
      "five o'clock in spite of ingenious excuses, and when she mounted her\n",
      "horse she galloped for the country at such a rate of speed that the\n",
      "drowsy town turned over. When she reached a long and lonely stretch of\n",
      "road she indulged herself in snatches of Spanish songs, and when she was\n",
      "at home she did not go to bed till near midnight, so happy was she in\n",
      "the contemplation of her solitude.\n",
      "VII\n",
      "Gwynne found few letters awaiting him; he had not encouraged\n",
      "correspondence, and only his mother, Flora Thangue, and his solicitors\n",
      "knew his address. It had been announced and reiterated in London that he\n",
      "was making a tour of the world. During the first month of his absence\n",
      "Lady Victoria had sent him a large bundle of clippings from newspapers,\n",
      "some acid in comment upon his obvious intention of neglecting his duties\n",
      "as a peer of the realm, his fruitless exposure of a chagrin at an\n",
      "elevation in which he would find more and more consolation as time went\n",
      "on. A few were sympathetic. Others went so far as to indicate a program\n",
      "in which he might serve his country with modesty, if not with the\n",
      "scintillations of the free-lance; and reminded him that peers had risen\n",
      "to the post of prime-minister ere this, of viceroy, lord-lieutenant,\n",
      "governor-general, and ambassador. Then, apparently, they dismissed him.\n",
      "The fiscal question was acute. Dissolution threatened. There were bright\n",
      "particular stars still in both parties, and the press and public had\n",
      "enough to do with sitting in judgment upon their respective rays.\n",
      "In the two letters from his mother, written at Homburg, there was no\n",
      "news beyond the letting of the properties and a bulletin of her health,\n",
      "which promised an imminent fitness for travel. His solicitors wrote that\n",
      "the income from the two estates was ample to keep the numerous women of\n",
      "the family in comfort, and leave a surplus which should be paid to his\n",
      "mother, according to his directions. This, with the southern ranch and\n",
      "the San Francisco property, should yield her an income of two thousand\n",
      "five hundred pounds a year. The confidential member of the firm hinted\n",
      "that if his lordship found means of increasing her ladyship's income in\n",
      "that land of gold and plenty it would be wise to do so, as her ladyship\n",
      "knew less than nothing of economy and was even more deeply in debt than\n",
      "usual.\n",
      "He missed Flora's gay letter of gossip, and looked with narrowing lids\n",
      "at the pile of newspapers. None had been sent him before, and he had\n",
      "left not a subscription behind him; but it was evident that his mother\n",
      "and Flora were under the mistaken impression that he would welcome this\n",
      "greeting in his new home. They had accumulated for a month. He\n",
      "recognized the type of the leading dailies, and could guess the names of\n",
      "the numerous illustrated weeklies. Suddenly he took them in his arms and\n",
      "walked quickly over to the stove, his eye roving in search of a\n",
      "match-box. But even as he stooped he rose again, and, blushing for his\n",
      "weakness, carried them back to the table, tore them open with nervous\n",
      "haste. He skimmed the great pages of the dailies from start to finish,\n",
      "telling himself that he must have a breath from home, news from\n",
      "authoritative sources, stated in excellent English; sickened with the\n",
      "knowledge that he was but searching eagerly for a word of himself;\n",
      "sickening more when he found none. Then he fell upon the weeklies, his\n",
      "eye glancing indifferently from the paragraphs and presentments of the\n",
      "royal and the engaged, but scanning every personality. He had had one\n",
      "rival and there was much of him.\n",
      "Before he had finished the third his struggling pride conquered. He\n",
      "gathered the heap and flung it into a corner, then caught up his hat and\n",
      "struck out for the loneliest part of the ranch. He writhed in the throes\n",
      "of disappointment, jealousy, disgust of self. He attempted consolation\n",
      "by picturing all the other ambitious men he knew exhibiting a similar\n",
      "weakness and vanity when there was no eye to see. His imagination did\n",
      "not rise to marvellous feats--and what if it did not? He had never\n",
      "aspired to be in the same class with other men.\n",
      "The bitter tide receded only to give place to apprehension. His\n",
      "temperament was mercurial, balanced by a certain languor in the earlier\n",
      "stages of emotion, and there had been little to depress his spirit\n",
      "during those thirty years when all the fairies had danced attendance on\n",
      "him; even defeat had but intoxicated his fighting instinct and given\n",
      "another excuse for flattery and encouragement. During the eleven months\n",
      "since he had left England he had experienced neither encouragement nor\n",
      "flattery. He could not recall having made a profound impression upon any\n",
      "of his casual acquaintances; he certainly had created no sensation. It\n",
      "was true that his role had been that of the listener, the student, but\n",
      "he had so long accepted himself as a personality, as the most remarkable\n",
      "of England's younger productions, that he had been deeply mortified more\n",
      "than once at the cavalier treatment of middle-aged business men with no\n",

      "if his success in England, as well as his phenomenal self-confidence,\n",
      "had not been merely the result of an inordinate ambition fed by\n",
      "fortuitous circumstances. He recalled that from childhood his\n",

      "since his departure incognito from England, and that he had deliberately\n",
      "held self-analysis at bay by incessant travel and a compulsory interest\n",
      "in subjects that did not appeal to him in the least. It was this absence\n",
      "of interest after close upon a year in the country that appalled him as\n",
      "much as his inner visioning. He hated the country. He hated its\n",
      "politics, both parties impartially. He hated all the questions that\n",

      "civilization, and her very faults were interesting; far removed from the\n",

      "he was an idealist to the point of knight-errantry, the desire for\n",

      "fate of a good many American reformers. There were several in high\n",
      "places at present, cheerfully trimmed down from the statesman to the\n",
      "political ideal. Julia Kaye--clever woman!--had put the matter into an\n",
      "epigram. The American statesman was the superior politician.\n",
      "And how was he, out of tune with every phase of the country, to find the\n",
      "ghost of an opportunity to lead it? He was no actor. If he had a merit\n",
      "it was sincerity, a contempt for subterfuge as beneath both his powers\n",
      "and the lofty position to which he had been born. Moreover, he was\n",
      "honest; an equally aristocratic failing and drawback.\n",
      "He recalled a conversation he had held in the smoking-compartment of a\n",
      "Pullman with a sharp young politician, who had become voluble after\n",
      "Gwynne had \"stood him\" two high-balls.\n",

      "The face as sharp as a razor but by no means dishonest rose before\n",

      "had travelled together he had displayed a photograph of his wife and\n",
      "\"kids,\" to whom he seemed even sentimentally devoted. Although Gwynne\n",
      "had parted from the man with satisfaction it was impossible to despise\n",
      "him utterly. Since then he had met many of his kind, more or less\n",
      "honest, able, pettily ambitious, fairly educated, unlearned on every\n",
      "subject except politics and the general business of the country; and all\n",
      "equally unsympathetic. He made no pretence to judge the country on its\n",
      "social or intellectual side, for he had been forced to avoid all groups\n",
      "that might have enlightened him--although he found no difficulty in\n",
      "assuming that well-bred and intellectual people were much the same the\n",
      "world over, and was willing to give the United States the benefit of\n",
      "every doubt. But its obvious side was the one that concerned him and his\n",
      "career. In order to succeed--and without success life would mean less\n",
      "than nothing to him--must he in a measure conform to conditions that\n",
      "were the result of a century of complexities? He recurred to the dry\n",
      "biographical sketches he had received, from certain of his travelling\n",
      "companions, of the most distinguished--and successful!--men in American\n",
      "politics to-day. Their ideals and their zeal for reform had played\n",
      "between horizon and zenith like a flaming sword, so compelling the\n",
      "attention of all that would pause to look that the diminishing\n",
      "effulgence had been even more conspicuous; and now, although the sword\n",
      "was occasionally brandished for form's sake, and was even sharper than\n",
      "before, having learned to cut both ways, it had the rust of tin not of\n",
      "blood on it, and deceived no one. But it had served its purpose--if to\n",
      "be sure it had been needed at all--and its owners were past-masters of\n",
      "success. Had he in him the makings of the mere trimmer and politician,\n",
      "in addition to the miserable vanity that had riven him to-day? And would\n",
      "some measure of great success won on those lines stir the dormant\n",
      "greatness in him?--if there were any greatness to stir. This was the\n",
      "fearful doubt, after all, that beset him. He almost saw with his outer\n",
      "vision his ideals lying in a tumbled heap, as he felt himself on the\n",
      "point of crying aloud that to feel once more that sense of power which\n",
      "had exalted him above mere mortals, and given him an ecstasy of spirit\n",
      "that no other passion could ever excite, he would sacrifice everything,\n",
      "everything!\n",
      "He paused abruptly and looked about him. He was half-way up the\n",
      "mountain. The great valley, that looked as if it might embrace the State\n",
      "itself, lay before him. North and south the scenery was magnificent,\n",
      "ethereal in the distance, melting everywhere into one of those lovely\n",
      "mists that seem to have extracted the spiritual essence of all the\n",
      "colors. But the very beauty of his new domain added to the sense of\n",
      "unreality, of uneasiness, that had so often possessed him since he had\n",
      "crossed the borders of the State. And it was all on such a colossal\n",
      "scale. There could never be anything friendly, anything possessing, in a\n",
      "land destined for a race of primeval giants. He felt so passionate a\n",
      "longing for the sweet embracing historied landscapes of England that the\n",
      "very violence of the nostalgia drove him homeward with the half-formed\n",
      "intention of taking the first train for New York and the first steamer\n",
      "out of it. Moreover, he was suddenly obsessed with the belief that if he\n",
      "had greatness in him England alone held its magnet.\n",
      "But it was a long walk to his house, and he reached it late in the\n",
      "afternoon, very tired and very hungry. When he entered his comfortable\n",
      "living-room, redolent of flowers, he received something like a shock of\n",
      "peace, and after he had taken a cold bath, he cursed himself roundly for\n",
      "permitting the mixed blood in his veins to contrive at times the\n",
      "temperament of an artist or of some women. As he sat down to a more than\n",
      "palatable supper, he felt thankful that he had had it out with himself\n",
      "so early in the engagement, and thought it odd if the Anglo-Saxon in him\n",
      "could not drive rough-shod over his weaker outcroppings.\n",
      "VIII\n",
      "He did not see Isabel again for three weeks. Several days after his\n",
      "arrival he received a note from her, briefly stating that she was\n",
      "starting for Los Angeles to exhibit her prize Favarolles and Leghorns at\n",
      "a \"Chicken show,\" and after that would pay a long deferred visit to her\n",
      "sister. \"But I shall not be long,\" she added, possibly with a flicker of\n",
      "contrition, \"only they have been planning things for me for ages and I\n",
      "am always putting them off. I will spend a week--not with them, exactly,\n",
      "but at their disposal, and it will be a relief to have it over.\"\n",
      "Gwynne felt himself ill-treated, but shrugged his shoulders with a new\n",
      "philosophy not all doggedness, and easily stretched to embrace the\n",
      "vagaries of woman. And, in truth, he found an abundance of occupation.\n",
      "Ascertaining that Mr. Leslie was away, he spent his time on the ranch,\n",
      "examining its various yields, divisions, possibilities; to say nothing\n",
      "of its books and history. The dairy was now an insignificant affair,\n",
      "experiments having proved disastrous, and his superintendent advised him\n",
      "to let it remain so. The greatest yield was in hay, and cattle raised\n",
      "for the market. The last lessee had come to grief over blood horses, and\n",
      "Gwynne's agents had accepted what remained of the racers and breeders in\n",
      "default of apocryphal cash. Although advised that they could be sold to\n",
      "advantage if haste were not imperative, Gwynne, who had a large balance\n",
      "in the bank, determined to continue the experiment. Many acres of the\n",
      "ranch were profitably let, although by the month only, as pasture both\n",
      "for cows and horses. The orchards always made a handsome yield, and the\n",
      "vegetable garden and strawberry beds needed only proper care to become\n",
      "remunerative. Moreover, several acres had recently been planted with\n",
      "kale, a favorite food of the conquering Leghorn, and there were fine\n",
      "runs on the hills that might be fenced off for sheep--or chickens; but\n",
      "at this point the superintendent always detected something even defiant\n",
      "in his employer's cold indifference, and told his friends that the\n",
      "Englishman was \"haughty in spots.\"\n",
      "It was all very satisfactory, but in order to bring him a really\n",
      "considerable increase of income he must dismiss his superintendent--who\n",
      "now drew a salary of a hundred and fifty dollars a month, and who did\n",
      "not inspire him with unbounded trust--and become his own manager, an\n",
      "office which would not only make heavy demands upon his time, turning\n",
      "him virtually into a farmer, with little leisure for the reading and\n",
      "practice of law, but no doubt involve the sacrifice of money as well; he\n",
      "did not flatter himself that he could learn to \"run\" a ranch of nineteen\n",
      "thousand varied acres in a season. His superintendent was a half-breed\n",
      "Mexican, the son of his cook, quick, voluble, and experienced in the\n",
      "ways of the ranch, upon which he had worked since boyhood. Gwynne had\n",
      "called on Mr. Colton at the bank two days after his arrival, and the old\n",
      "gentleman, who had an eye like a gimlet and a mouth like a steel trap,\n",
      "had consigned all \"greasers\" to subterranean fires, and emphasized the\n",
      "fact that he had hired Carlos Smith by the month only. A better man\n",
      "would demand a year's contract. There were infinite possibilities for\n",
      "\"the greaser\" to pocket a goodly share of the profits, and \"cover up his\n",
      "tracks.\" And it might be a year or two before a superintendent could be\n",
      "found capable in every way of managing so complicated a ranch.\n",
      "While he was still revolving the problem he met Mr. Leslie and Tom\n",
      "Colton, who advised him to sell at least half the ranch to small\n",
      "farmers. Properties of four and five acres were in increasing demand in\n",
      "this fertile county, and equally difficult to obtain. He had but the one\n",
      "interview with them, as they were starting the same day to attend to\n",
      "some business in the north, but after revolving the matter in all its\n",
      "bearings for another ten days he made up his mind to accept their\n",
      "advice, consoled his crestfallen superintendent with the promise of\n",
      "constant work, and set forth one afternoon to place his advertisements.\n",
      "He had visited the town but twice since his arrival, and then in the\n",
      "morning. To-day he saw it characteristically for the first time. The\n",
      "hills that formed a cove of the great valley were bright with their\n",
      "houses and gardens, but very quiet. The long sloping block of Main\n",
      "Street was crowded with wagons, buggies, and horses, that from a\n",
      "distance looked to be a solid mass; and even when he rode into their\n",
      "midst he found some difficulty in forcing his way. Where the dusty\n",
      "vehicles were not moving they were tied to every post, the horses with\n",
      "their front feet on the sidewalk observing the familiar throng with\n",
      "friendly patient eyes. The shops were doing a rushing business, and so,\n",
      "Gwynne inferred, were the banks. As for the saloons, their doors swung\n",
      "with mechanical precision. Most of the farmers wore linen dusters and\n",
      "broad straw hats, but their women had put on all their finery. The girls\n",
      "of the town could be readily distinguished by their crisp muslins and\n",
      "white hats and absence of dust. There were groups of Rosewater girls\n",
      "holding rendezvous with their country cousins everywhere, although for\n",
      "the most part in the drug stores, which, with their tiled floors and\n",
      "ample space, looked like public reception-rooms. There were many knots\n",
      "of men under the broad roof over the pavement, but in spite of the\n",
      "ubiquitous saloon no drunkenness. Nor was there a policeman in sight.\n",
      "Nor a shop for fire-arms. Gone were the old days when a man drank till\n",
      "his brain was fire and his pistol went off by itself. The sting had been\n",
      "extracted from California and she had settled down to practical\n",
      "consideration of her vast resources; and in the comfortable assurance\n",
      "that there was enough for all. Gwynne had not seen a beggar nor a pauper\n",
      "since his arrival.\n",
      "He placed his advertisements with both the local newspapers, to avoid\n",
      "the ill-will of either, posted others to the San Francisco press, and\n",
      "was riding down Main Street in order to have a closer look at the long\n",
      "hitching-rail lined on either side with another solid mass of horses and\n",
      "vehicles, when he caught sight of Isabel driving a buggy and evidently\n",
      "searching for an empty post. He laid aside his grievance and made his\n",
      "way to her side. She quite beamed with welcome, and they disentangled\n",
      "themselves into a side street, where there were empty posts.\n",
      "\"I only got home at half-past eleven last night,\" she informed him. \"The\n",
      "boat was three hours late in starting, and when I finally made up my\n",
      "mind to come by train the last had gone. So I overslept this morning or\n",
      "I should have gone out to see you. But I meant to telephone you from\n",
      "here and ask you to come out for the first duck-shooting--\"\n",
      "\"Duck-shooting!\" Gwynne forgot the grievance.\n",
      "\"The season opens to-day--the fifteenth of October. I had meant really\n",
      "to ask you for the first thing this morning. Never mind, we have plenty\n",
      "of time, and you will not have to go home for anything. Just wait here\n",
      "until I do my errands.\"\n",
      "He tied his horse next to hers and sat down in the shade on a chair\n",
      "provided by a friendly store-keeper. In less than half an hour she\n",
      "returned, and they started for Old Inn. Isabel had never seemed so\n",
      "charming to him as they rode slowly out of the town and along the dusty\n",
      "road. Smiling and sparkling, she asked him rapid eager questions about\n",
      "his ranch, his plans, his comforts, whom he had met, how he had passed\n",
      "his days and evenings. The truth was she had practically forgotten him,\n",
      "and her conscience smote her. Her week in San Francisco had waxed to a\n",
      "fortnight, for she had enjoyed herself far more than was usual in the\n",
      "company of her relatives. Lyster Stone was one of the most agreeable of\n",
      "men when debts were not more than usually pressing, and as he had just\n",
      "painted a drop curtain and sold a picture for a considerable sum, he had\n",
      "replenished his own elaborate wardrobe, given his wife a new frock,\n",
      "silenced the loudest of his creditors, and thought it worth while to\n",
      "\"blow the rest in\" on a sister-in-law who seemed to have no taste for\n",
      "matrimony. Moreover, he really liked and admired her, and he liked still\n",
      "more to spend money. When his pockets were full of actual coin he\n",
      "abandoned himself to sheer happiness. Debt had bred philosophy;\n",
      "moreover, his wife relieved him of too depressing a contact with duns,\n",
      "and there were times when his respite was longer than he deserved. If\n",
      "his Paula had a little way of cajoling the amount out of her sister's\n",
      "pocket, why not? He had never refused a friend in need, and, in truth,\n",
      "could see no use for money except to spend it. If all the world did not\n",
      "wag his way, so much the worse for cold-blooded mercenary superfluous\n",
      "beings. So, the two weeks had been a round of dinners at the gay\n",
      "Bohemian restaurants, chafing-dish suppers at his own and other studios,\n",
      "the theatre and opera, and long walks about the brilliant streets at\n",
      "night. It was all the more interesting to Isabel from its odd wild\n",
      "likeness to foreign life. She had heard much of this American\n",
      "\"continental\" flavor of San Francisco life, only to be tasted by\n",
      "artificial light, and she had given herself up to it with an abandon of\n",
      "which she possessed a sufficient reserve. But one cloud had risen on the\n",
      "blue, and as it emptied itself in a torrent, it was a matter for\n",
      "congratulation that it had tarried the fortnight.\n",
      "A woman of growing wealth, who affected artists' society, had continued\n",
      "to live in her pretty odd little house, but had recently done it up like\n",
      "a stuffed and scented jeweller's box. The tiny salon was her pride. It\n",
      "was all cherry satin and white lace, the furniture lilliputian, to match\n",
      "the proportions of the room and the lady. She was large-eyed,\n",
      "dark-haired, pretty, and the room set her off admirably. It was here\n",
      "that she invariably received her artist friends, and felt herself at\n",
      "last set in a definite niche, in the city of individualities. One day,\n",
      "in a spasm of generosity, she bade Stone, calling in a mood of unusual\n",
      "depression, to paint it, and sell for his own benefit what, at least,\n",
      "should be a glowing bit of still life. Stone began his work next day,\n",
      "meaning, when the seductive interior was finished, to induce his patron\n",
      "to sit on the doll-like sofa for a portrait, irresistible alike to her\n",
      "vanity and pocket. But she capriciously went off to New York for\n",
      "clothes, and he exhibited the picture in the shop of a dealer where\n",
      "buyers were not infrequent. Thence, indeed, in the course of a few days\n",
      "went a wealthy broker whose sign was three balls. He liked the picture,\n",
      "but bargained that himself should sit on the sofa. His offer was\n",
      "generous. Stone, to do him justice, demurred, for all Bohemia, at least,\n",
      "knew the room. But Mrs. Paula wept at the thought of the lost hundreds,\n",
      "and he succumbed. The result, at the owner's insistence, was exhibited.\n",
      "The lady returned as unexpectedly as she had flown, and was asked at\n",
      "every step if she had \"seen her room.\" Scenting mystery, she went\n",
      "to the gallery; and stood petrified before the faithful presentment\n",
      "of her cherry-colored satin boudoir, the very edge of the sofa\n",
      "accommodating a large gentleman with an eminent nose, a bulging\n",
      "shirt-front--diamond-studded--and knees long severed. He looked like a\n",
      "Hebraic Gulliver in Lilliput, and the unities were in tatters. She\n",
      "stared, stuttered, wept. And then she descended upon Stone.\n",
      "Gwynne laughed heartily as Isabel related the episode, but they fell\n",
      "into silence after they crossed the bridge and were able to accelerate\n",
      "their pace. He made no effort to break it, although Isabel had never\n",
      "found him more polite. She also thought him vastly improved with his\n",
      "thick coat of tan, and almost picturesque in his khaki riding-clothes\n",
      "and high boots. There were more subtle changes in him which it was too\n",
      "warm and dusty to speculate upon at the moment.\n",
      "Gwynne had restrained his spontaneous delight in seeing Isabel again.\n",
      "Not only did he have a genuine grievance in her neglect of him, but he\n",
      "had no intention that she should fancy he had need of anything she could\n",
      "give him, beyond superficial companionship and advice. More than once\n",
      "during the past weeks he had caught himself longing so miserably for her\n",
      "sympathy and the support of her strong independent character that it had\n",
      "alarmed him. He realized for the first time what a prop and resource the\n",
      "deep maturity and scornful strength of his mother had been. He must\n",
      "brace and reinforce his character at all points if he persisted in his\n",
      "determination to achieve the colossal task he had set for himself.\n",
      "Woman's sympathy was all very well for some men, or for him in more\n",
      "toward circumstances, but he had looked deeply into himself and been\n",
      "terrified at unsuspected weaknesses. He had set his teeth and determined\n",
      "to fight his fight alone. If he failed, at least he would have the\n",
      "consolation of never having cried out to a woman: \"Give me your help! I\n",
      "need you!\"\n",
      "He did not betray the least of this, but his first remark as they rested\n",
      "the horses on the slight hill leading to Isabel's ranch was less\n",
      "irrelevant than it may have seemed to himself.\n",
      "\"I suppose you met all sorts of interesting Johnnies in that beloved San\n",
      "Francisco of yours,\" he said, abruptly.\n",
      "\"Of course. It will be quite cool in an hour and we can go out.\n",
      "Fortunately I never gave away Uncle Hiram's shooting-togs, and he was\n",
      "quite your height and figure. We'll take tea and sandwiches with us so\n",
      "that we need not hurry home for supper.\"\n",
      "She suddenly forgot the ducks and pointed with her whip at the low hills\n",
      "behind her house. The runs were covered with several thousand\n",
      "snow-white, red-combed chickens, and all their little white houses shone\n",
      "in the sun. The effect was by no means inartistic, but Gwynne elevated\n",
      "his nose. He hated the sight of chickens.\n",
      "\"Did you ever see anything more beautiful than that?\" asked Isabel,\n",
      "proudly. \"They all know me, and I love every one of them.\"\n",
      "\"I don't doubt there is money in them,\" said Gwynne, dryly. \"But as a\n",
      "pet I should prefer even a cat.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, I only pet them when they are ill. There is an old feather-bed in\n",
      "the house, and I put them in that when they need nursing at night. That\n",
      "is a device of my own, and much better than going out at twelve o'clock\n",
      "on a cold dark night. By-the-way, I think your idea of selling half or\n",
      "more of Lumalitas admirable. Great tracts of land in this part of the\n",
      "State are out of date, and more bother than they are worth, anywhere.\n",
      "You can invest the money to great advantage in San Francisco; but I\n",
      "think you should devote the rest of the ranch to chickens--\"\n",
      "\"No, madam!\" Gwynne turned upon her the glittering eye of an animal at\n",
      "bay. Then he laughed. \"I have heard that proposition from every man I\n",
      "have met and daily from my superintendent until I managed to suppress\n",
      "him. I won't have a chicken on the ranch. The sight of them not only\n",
      "fills me with ennui, but I have no intention of presenting your comic\n",
      "papers with material. I could write their jokes myself--'_Gwynne before\n",
      "and after_': Westminster in the background and a hayseed figure in front\n",
      "addressing a constituency of chickens. Stumping the country with eggs in\n",
      "my pockets for the children. Dining the eminent members of my\n",
      "constituency on horse-meat, under the delusion that what is good for\n",
      "chickens is good for votes. 'Leghorn Gwynne.' 'The Member from\n",
      "Chickenville.' No thanks. No weapons that I can withhold.\"\n",
      "IX\n",
      "\"This is all on my ranch,\" said Isabel; \"so there is no danger of being\n",
      "peppered. The rest of the marsh is owned by clubs, and as there was no\n",
      "shooting here last year the ducks should be thicker than anywhere else.\n",
      "We should get our fifty apiece in no time.\"\n",
      "They were entering a narrow slough, hardly wider than the boat. It cut\n",
      "its zigzag way through the marsh for many miles, and they could follow\n",
      "its course with the eye but a few feet at a time. Gwynne shipped the\n",
      "oars and began to scull, his gun across his knee. Isabel, in front and\n",
      "with her back to him, sat with her own gun ready for a shot. On one side\n",
      "of them was a large piece of marsh-land, on the left, smaller patches,\n",
      "and little islands caught in the long grasping fingers of the tide.\n",
      "Gwynne had attired himself with an ill grace in a pair of his cousin\n",
      "Hiram's rubber boots that completely covered his body below the waist,\n",
      "and an old shooting-coat with capacious pockets. Isabel wore a similar\n",
      "costume, and but for her hair might have been mistaken for a lad. She\n",
      "possessed no interest for Gwynne whatever at the moment. Nor did\n",
      "anything else but the prospect of a new and exciting sport. The October\n",
      "evening was mellow and full of color, the entire reach of the marsh\n",
      "steeped in a golden haze shed from the glory in the west. Even the\n",
      "forests and the lower ridges rising to Tamalpais had something aqueous\n",
      "in their vague outlines, swayed gently in the golden tide. Only the tide\n",
      "lands were green; the very water was yellow. Here and there, but far\n",
      "away, a mast or sail rose above the level surface of the marsh. From the\n",
      "distance came the sound of constant shooting.\n",
      "Gwynne sculled silently, but with some impatience. They had left the\n",
      "open creek far behind and had not seen a duck. Suddenly Isabel's gun\n",
      "leaped to her shoulder. They rounded a sharp point and the whole surface\n",
      "of the narrow slough between them and the next bend was black with\n",
      "sleeping ducks. Gwynne's knee moved automatically to the seat in front\n",
      "of him, and as the startled birds rose he and Isabel fired to right and\n",
      "left. The scattering shot played havoc, and the second charge brought\n",
      "down at least half as many on the higher wing. Isabel reloaded the guns\n",
      "while Gwynne went for the ducks that had fallen on the land. He fell\n",
      "into several holes himself, and returned covered with mud, but waving\n",
      "his birds in triumph; and once more they stole softly along their\n",
      "winding way. The shot had roused neighboring flocks; several dark clouds\n",
      "had risen simultaneously, but in a few moments they settled again.\n",
      "\"You had better use both guns,\" whispered Isabel, \"and I will do the\n",
      "reloading. We can't do much with these old-fashioned things at best.\"\n",
      "Gwynne accepted this act of sacrifice with a matter-of-fact nod, and it\n",
      "was but a moment later that they came upon another flock. He fired with\n",
      "an accuracy of aim that won him an admiring mutter, although to miss\n",
      "would have been almost as noteworthy. But after repeating this\n",
      "experience several times, he shrugged his shoulders and announced\n",
      "himself blase.\n",
      "\"I'd like something a little more difficult,\" he said. \"Ten minutes of\n",
      "this and we can glut the market.\"\n",
      "\"All men are children,\" said Isabel, indulgently. \"Tie up the boat and\n",
      "we'll go after widgeon.\"\n",
      "They landed and stole softly over the larger reach of marsh-land, Isabel\n",
      "in the lead as she knew every hole. It was ten minutes before she raised\n",
      "her hand and pointed to a wilted but still effective screen. Under cover\n",
      "of this they crawled towards a large pond on which ducks were resting\n",
      "but by no means asleep. Before the guns were shouldered they had taken\n",
      "flight; so few were brought down on the wing that Gwynne's interest\n",
      "revived, and he followed Isabel eagerly towards another pond with a\n",
      "better blind. Here they were more wary and more fortunate, and Isabel\n",
      "took a curious pleasure in watching the manifest bliss of her companion.\n",
      "She had never seen him look really happy before. Upon his return to\n",
      "Capheaton from his triumphant battle on the hustings he had been as\n",
      "impassive as his traditions demanded. On the morning of his engagement\n",
      "he had looked rather silly to her detached eye; and immediately after,\n",
      "tragedy and trouble and infinite vexation had claimed him. But this\n",
      "evening, with his cap pushed back, his nostrils distended, his eyes\n",
      "sparkling, he looked like any other young fellow to whom the present was\n",
      "all. Isabel reflected somewhat cynically that it was the opportunity to\n",
      "kill something that had effected this momentary reconciliation with\n",
      "life. But she was too good a sportswoman not to understand his mood, and\n",
      "when he had waded into the lake and returned flushed and triumphant with\n",
      "his bag, she complimented him so warmly that he laughed aloud in sheer\n",
      "delight.\n",
      "\"We have enough for once,\" she began, but he would not hear of returning\n",
      "to the boat even for the refreshment of tea, and they went on and on\n",
      "until their feet were as weary as their shoulders under the burden that\n",
      "was Isabel's part to string while her partner enjoyed himself.\n",
      "\"But we must really go,\" she announced, finally. \"We have a long stretch\n",
      "out in the open creek after we leave the slough, and it is not so easy\n",
      "to keep the channel after dark. I have lost track of things and don't\n",
      "remember what time the moon rises. You can come every day if you like;\n",
      "and four in the morning is the best time if you are energetic enough--\"\n",
      "\"I would get up at midnight--stay up all night. But I am quite willing\n",
      "to return now--and not for tea. I should like several of these ducks for\n",
      "supper, if your Jap is less haughty than mine.\"\n",
      "Their way lay through the middle of the marsh-land. It was not until\n",
      "they reached the slough that she uttered a loud sharp cry. The boat was\n",
      "at least three feet below them and there was nothing at either end but\n",
      "mud.\n",
      "Isabel stamped both feet in succession and flung her burden to the\n",
      "ground. \"Why, _why_ did I take Mac's word?\" she exclaimed, furiously.\n",
      "\"He always makes mistakes about the tide--he hasn't an inch of memory\n",
      "left. Why didn't I look at the calendar? Or think? This comes of going\n",
      "off for three weeks instead of staying at home and attending to\n",
      "business. I had a confused idea that this was the 'good week.' Great\n",
      "heavens!\"\n",
      "Gwynne had watched her with considerable interest and curiosity. But he\n",
      "answered, soothingly: \"Well, what of it? The tide turns, doesn't it.\" It\n",
      "happened that he had had no experience of marsh-lands.\n",
      "\"Yes--in six hours.\"\n",
      "\"Six hours! Well, what of it? It is all in the day's work. Look at it as\n",
      "a jolly adventure.\" It was his first opportunity to console and he\n",
      "hastened to take advantage of it. \"We have tea and sandwiches, warm\n",
      "enough clothing, and the weather is perfection. If we get stiff and\n",
      "chilly we can walk--\"\n",
      "\"Walk? In these rubber boots? I am nearly dead already.\" She had a wild\n",
      "impulse to drop her head on his shoulder and weep; but her pride flew to\n",
      "the front and she shrugged her shoulders and remarked, airily: \"I don't\n",
      "really mind anything much except being an idiot. However, I'll make it\n",
      "up to you. I can cook ducks better than Chuma. You make the tea.\"\n",
      "Gwynne made a fire out of decayed tule weed and driftwood, then climbed\n",
      "down into the boat and brought up the provisions and utensils intended\n",
      "for an earlier interlude. The tea warmed and stimulated both, and they\n",
      "knelt by the fire and toasted the ducks at the end of the boat-hook,\n",
      "scowling with a preternatural earnestness both were too hungry to\n",
      "observe. Then they fell to, and it is doubtful if either had ever eaten\n",
      "with a keener relish. They were obliged to use their fingers, and, as\n",
      "they had no salt, to shred the ham and wrap it about the morsels of\n",
      "duck, but to such minor matters they gave not a thought, and consumed\n",
      "four teals and every scrap they had brought from home, as well as\n",
      "another pot of tea. Isabel, recalling the injured air of her father,\n",
      "uncle, and brother-in-law when their comfort was rudely disturbed,\n",
      "warmed to Gwynne, who was good-humored and amused. Even the reflection\n",
      "that he had roughed it in far worse straits than this, or that had he\n",
      "the legal right to grumble he might possibly use it, did not alter the\n",
      "pleasant impression he made as he tramped out the fire, washed his hands\n",
      "in the marsh grass, and then stretched himself full length with his\n",
      "pipe. She lit a cigarette, but had not smoked half its length when she\n",
      "sprang to her feet.\n",
      "\"Look!\" she said. \"We must get into the boat. It is getting damper every\n",
      "moment, and the fog will make us feel as if we were in our graves if we\n",
      "don't sit on something dry.\"\n",
      "She had pointed northward, and Gwynne saw a phantom mountain moving\n",
      "along the level surface of the marsh with the quiet plodding motion of a\n",
      "ship under full sail in a light breeze. The curious combination of\n",
      "images fascinated him, and he watched the stealthy silent progress of\n",
      "this night visitor from the tule lands of the north, that looked as if\n",
      "it might have obliterated the world. As he jumped down into the boat he\n",
      "saw before him, on three sides of him, the sparkling night. Then as\n",
      "Isabel laid her hands on his shoulders and he lifted her down, the fog\n",
      "swept over them, and there was nothing to do but sit and watch the glow\n",
      "of pipe and cigarette; even their own outlines were barely visible.\n",
      "\"I fancy it will go home when the moon rises,\" said Isabel, with a\n",
      "little shiver. \"Are you cold?\" she asked, solicitously.\n",
      "\"No,\" replied a tart voice. \"Why didn't you let me ask that? You are not\n",
      "my mother. We can make tea at intervals. How long do you suppose the\n",
      "tide has been out?\"\n",
      "\"About two hours.\"\n",
      "\"I am quite comfortable and have never resented any adventure. And this\n",
      "is the appropriate time and place for a certain story. As I remarked\n",
      "before I shall not know you until I have heard it. Pasts are dead\n",
      "walls.\"\n",
      "\"It is not necessary that you should know me.\"\n",
      "\"I think otherwise. You are my one friend among eighty millions of\n",
      "aliens, or ought to be. I shall continue to feel a superior sort of\n",
      "acquaintance until you have taken me into your confidence.\"\n",
      "There was a movement of the fog that he inferred was a shrug. \"Very\n",
      "well,\" she replied, without a break in her cool even voice. \"I suppose I\n",
      "shall enjoy talking about myself. It is not often I have had the\n",
      "opportunity to indulge in a monologue in my family, and you certainly\n",
      "are at my mercy. If you attempt to flee you will be mired like the boat,\n",
      "and I could not pull you out.\"\n",
      "He had never felt the least curiosity about the past history or the\n",
      "inner life of a mortal before, and in normal circumstances Isabel's\n",
      "would not have appealed to him. But her instrumentality in changing the\n",
      "whole current of his life had alarmed his masculinity into a resolve to\n",
      "demonstrate his superiority if it came to a contest of wills; given\n",
      "birth to a subtle assumption of proprietorship, indifferent in material\n",
      "things, but pressing towards the guarded chambers of the spirit. Isabel,\n",
      "vaguely uneasy earlier in the day, began to appreciate the advance of an\n",
      "outer and powerful force upon her precious freedom, and resented it. And\n",
      "while she made up her mind that if it came to a silent contest of wills,\n",
      "hers at least should not be conquered, she reflected that the deeper\n",
      "intimacy, certain to ensue if she gave him her confidence, would insure\n",
      "her a firmer and subtler hold upon his destinies.\n",
      "X\n",
      "\"Of course I lived two lives before my father's death. My days were\n",
      "sufficiently filled with him, to say nothing of making both ends meet;\n",
      "for even after my uncle's death, I had only a small income until the day\n",
      "of my complete liberty came. I slept soundly enough when I was not\n",
      "following my father about the house with a candle, or about the hills\n",
      "with a lantern. But such a life preyed upon my spirits. I imagined\n",
      "myself both melancholy and bitter and grew unhealthily romantic. But\n",
      "from the conditions of my life I had two escapes--in books and in\n",
      "dreams. My father hated company more and more and I rarely left him for\n",
      "a dance or one of those church festivities where all the young people of\n",
      "my set were sure to meet. I knew that I was regarded as rather a tragic\n",
      "figure, and this enhanced my morbid egoism. I wonder if I shall ever be\n",
      "as really happy again!\n",
      "\"During the year following my father's death I lived out here alone, but\n",
      "with my hands tied by the executors of my uncle's will. I felt myself\n",
      "quite the enchanted princess and put in most of my time dreaming about\n",
      "the prince. I suppose no girl ever had such wild and impossible notions\n",
      "of love. That is to say most girls have, but I had peculiar\n",
      "opportunities for indulgence and elaboration. At the same time I\n",
      "despised or disliked every man I knew or ever had known--with the\n",
      "possible exception of Judge Leslie. Not only had I found all the men of\n",
      "my little personal world weak, or selfish, or tyrannical, but those I\n",
      "knew almost as well were narrow, or commonplace, or uninterested in\n",
      "anything but local politics or making money, or both combined. Not but\n",
      "that Rosewater is the world in little. You never read of any old Italian\n",
      "duchy where there was more jealousy and intrigue; more silent and tense,\n",
      "or open and gnashing struggle for supremacy than is centered in these\n",
      "three banks. They have prevented the town from increasing in size and\n",
      "importance, in spite of its prosperity, through their machinations\n",
      "against one another. If a stranger comes to the town intending to invest\n",
      "his money in some one of the flourishing industries, or to introduce\n",
      "another, the banker to whom he brings a letter, or whom he happens to\n",
      "meet first, terrifies him with tales of the rapacity and dishonorable\n",
      "methods of his rivals; and the other two, who fear that the first will\n",
      "get the stranger's business, warn him that Mr. Colton, for instance,\n",
      "never gave an hour's mercy. The three have made slow, sure, dogged\n",
      "fortunes, but each has prevented the others from becoming millionaires,\n",
      "and Rosewater from taking its proper place as county seat. And they are\n",
      "all afraid of new-comers, new capital, of authority passing out of their\n",
      "hands. They are careful not to charge exorbitant rates of interest, and\n",
      "every farmer and merchant in the county borrows from them; partly from\n",
      "habit, partly because the banks are uncommonly sound. They foreclose\n",
      "without mercy, but that does not frighten their old patrons, who have\n",
      "the perennial optimism of the country. The only capital they have not\n",
      "succeeded in frightening off is that controlled by the great\n",
      "corporations. One or two have wedged their way in and others will follow\n",
      "in time. Doubtless when the younger men get the reins in their hands\n",
      "they will trim with the times, but the older seem to be Biblical if not\n",
      "Christian, and the consequence is that most of the younger have left for\n",
      "a wider field.\n",
      "\"Finally the day came when I could turn my back on California, and I\n",
      "felt sure that I should remain away for ten years at least. I thought\n",
      "that the liberty I had longed for all my life was mine at last. In a\n",
      "conducted tour, I soon discovered, there was little liberty, to say\n",
      "nothing of privacy. Before I had been two days in the train I was made\n",
      "to feel that there was something wrong with a person that showed a\n",
      "disposition to retire into herself. She was either aristocratic, or had\n",
      "something to hide, unless she responded to the confidences natural to\n",
      "people of that class. As there were just eighteen in the party, of\n",
      "course I always had a room partner, and there was not a woman in the\n",
      "entire company that I would have known from choice. However, it was\n",
      "excellent discipline, not unenlightening, and the end came in six weeks.\n",
      "They sailed from Naples and I wandered about by myself. In a way the\n",
      "liberty was intoxicating, but of course the sum of it was lessened by\n",
      "the daily irritations of travel in Europe: the rapacity of the Italians\n",
      "and French, the wretched trains, the hordes of vulgar tourists, mostly\n",
      "of my own nation, the absurd primness, quite foreign to my nature, I was\n",
      "forced to assume when alone with a man who was neither English nor\n",
      "American, the awful fatigues, the ennuis of long rainy days in the\n",
      "second-rate hotels and pensions I had to frequent. Still, I was too\n",
      "young for any unpleasant impression to take root and discourage me, and\n",
      "there was much that was wholly delightful. I spent weeks in a city or\n",
      "even village that took my fancy. But even so it was not long before I\n",
      "realized that my liberty was as far off as ever, because my soul at\n",
      "least was possessed by the image of the prince, the more tormenting and\n",
      "insistent as his outlines were so remarkably vague. In the intervals\n",
      "when novelty ceased to appeal, when my very eyes refused to look at\n",
      "things, I pictured inexpressibly thrilling and romantic futures. Then I\n",
      "would fall into a panic at the passing of youth, for a woman never feels\n",
      "so old again as between eighteen and twenty-five--her first\n",
      "quarter-century.\n",
      "\"And I did not lack opportunities. I met many people, some of them quite\n",
      "charming. But they left me cold.\n",
      "\"Then I lived the student life in Paris, studying art just enough to\n",
      "give me the raison d'etre. It was very gay, very irresponsible, very\n",
      "educating to a provincial miss. The restaurants with their sanded\n",
      "floors, and the cosmopolitan mixture of students, generally eccentric to\n",
      "look at, brandishing temperament until the poor thing must have been\n",
      "worn out before its harness of technique was ready--all was a perpetual\n",
      "source of delight to me, and I used to let my mind dwell on Rosewater\n",
      "for the sake of enjoying myself with the more wonder and gratitude.\n",
      "\"But of course in such a life I had to have a companion, I could not\n",
      "long go to students' restaurants alone. I had taken a tiny flat in the\n",
      "Latin Quarter at the top of a house, and overlooking a convent where the\n",
      "nuns were always walking in the garden. A _femme de menage_ cooked my\n",
      "breakfast and kept my rooms in order; but although I was quite\n",
      "comfortable and never lonely, I had not been established a fortnight\n",
      "before certain experiences at the restaurants and on the street, which\n",
      "you can imagine for yourself, convinced me that I could not live alone.\n",
      "So I looked hurriedly over the field, and decided that an American girl\n",
      "in my class suggested fewest complications. Moreover, she interested me.\n",
      "She had a pale tense face, rarely spoke to anybody, and worked as if her\n",
      "life depended upon every stroke, although her talent was not\n",
      "conspicuous. It was not easy to approach her, but one day, after I had\n",
      "dined alone in my flat five times in succession, I noticed that she was\n",
      "paler than usual, and that her hands were trembling. Then I felt certain\n",
      "she was in trouble, and it would have been my instinct to help her in\n",
      "any case. I joined her as we left the atelier, and asked her to walk a\n",
      "bit. It was not long before she admitted that her money was practically\n",
      "gone, and that her family would not send her any more; they had never\n",
      "approved of her coming to Paris to study art. They were not at all well\n",
      "off, and as she had a facility in trimming hats they had thought it her\n",
      "duty to contribute more immediately to the support of the family. She\n",
      "had not advanced as rapidly as she had hoped to do, and it would be\n",
      "insupportable humiliation to return.\n",
      "\"Here was my opportunity. I exultingly invited her to share my\n",
      "apartment, told her that my income was quite enough for two, that I was\n",

      "interested me more and more. Her real bitterness taught me what a purely\n",
      "youthful symptom mine had been, and she was rather a clever girl, often\n",
      "entertaining. She was about twenty-six, I fancy, and had received a good\n",
      "education at the academy of the Western town in which she had been born.\n",
      "Her grandparents were Italian emigrants, and she had fine black eyes\n",
      "and a beautiful mouth.\n",
      "\"Well, before many months had passed I knew that she was in desperate\n",
      "straits, and she offered to go away, reiterating that she had only\n",
      "intended to take advantage of the temporary haven while she fed her\n",
      "courage and painted something that might sell. I knew that if she left\n",
      "me she would throw herself into the Seine, and I persuaded her to stay.\n",

      "friendly roof. I was full of sympathy for the poor little thing, but I\n",
      "don't deny that I was immensely interested, and fairly palpitated with\n",
      "the thought that I was actually seeing life at first hand. Who the hero\n",
      "of her romance was I never discovered, except that he was of her own\n",
      "race, and married, a fact he had concealed until ready to leave Paris.\n",
      "She told me enough to make me hate all men so violently that the prince\n",
      "took himself off and left me in peace. But I had trouble enough in my\n",
      "household. As time went on Veronica's alternate attacks of melancholy\n",
      "and hysteria were terrible. I sat up night after night to keep her from\n",
      "throwing herself out of the window; at times she seemed to be quite off\n",
      "her head. And then she still loved the wretch, and would maunder by the\n",
      "hour. But it ended, as everything does; and the poor girl died. I have\n",
      "no desire to linger over the climax. If anything was needed to set the\n",
      "final seal upon my disgust with life at first hand it was the mean and\n",
      "sordid details that attend death and burial in Paris. The landlord\n",
      "behaved like the mercenary fiends they all are; I was obliged to call in\n",
      "the assistance of the American consul before I could get the body out of\n",
      "the house, and between all the trouble and fuss poor Veronica's story\n",
      "was published from the house-tops.\n",
      "\"As soon as it was over I left Paris and started to travel slowly\n",
      "through Germany, feeling now a real sense of liberty, inasmuch as I was\n",
      "sure I could be all intellect henceforth, dependent upon nothing so\n",
      "unsatisfactory as human happiness. I never wanted another real contact\n",
      "with life. I would travel, and study, and develop my mind, possibly some\n",
      "latent talent. Many talents are manufactured anyhow, and the world is\n",
      "always hailing them as genius.\n",
      "\"But, of course, in time, and with constant change of scene, to say\n",
      "nothing of youth, the impression faded; the painful experience hovered\n",
      "faintly in the background of the past; the romantic imp in my brain, a\n",
      "little pale and emaciated from its long sojourn in the cellar, resumed\n",
      "the throne. Once more I began to realize that I was human, and to cast\n",
      "about for the mate that must surely be roaming in search of me. It was\n",
      "then that I arrived in Munich.\n",
      "\"I saw him first in the Englischergarten. You remember it, that\n",
      "wonderful imitation of a great stretch of open country, with fields\n",
      "where they make hay, and bits of wild woods, and crooked pathways, and\n",
      "bridges over a branch of the Isar, greenest and loveliest of rivers. And\n",
      "then the little beer-gardens, where the people are always sitting and\n",
      "listening to the band--and beyond the tree-tops, the spires and domes of\n",
      "the beautiful city.\n",
      "\"I was standing by the lake watching the swans when he rode by, and I am\n",
      "bound to say that he made no great impression. I hardly should have\n",
      "noticed him had it not been for his excessively English appearance, and\n",
      "a certain piercing quality in the glance with which he favored me. I\n",
      "should never have given him another thought, but a week later I met him\n",
      "formally. It came about oddly enough.\n",
      "\"That evening in looking through my trunk for a business paper I came\n",
      "upon a letter of introduction given me by a friend I had made in Italy.\n",
      "It was to a Baroness L., of Munich. I had quite forgotten it, and the\n",
      "sight of it inspired me with no desire for the social curiosities. I was\n",
      "infatuated with Munich, and its exteriors satisfied me. It has a large\n",
      "courteous grandly-hospitable air, as if it were the private property of\n",
      "a king, to which, however, all strangers are royally welcome. It is the\n",
      "ideal king's city: life but no bustle; neither business, as we\n",
      "understand the word, nor poverty; a city of infinite leisure and\n",
      "infinite interest, a superb living picture-book, where one is ever\n",
      "amused, interested, both stimulated and soothed. I had been in it three\n",
      "weeks and had almost made up my mind to live there, and dream away the\n",
      "rest of my life. Knote and Morena, Feinhals and Bender were singing at\n",
      "the Hof Theatre. Mottl was conducting. Lili Marberg's Salome was\n",
      "something to be seen again and again. You forgot the play itself. And\n",
      "Bardou-Mueller's Mrs. Alving! I did not sleep for two nights.\n",
      "\"Well, I left the letter on my table, instead of returning it to the\n",
      "portfolio of my trunk, and it exercised a certain insistence. What are\n",
      "letters of introduction for? And should I not see the social life of\n",
      "Europe when the opportunity offered? So I left a card on the baroness.\n",
      "She returned it in the course of a day or two, then wrote, asking me to\n",
      "drink tea with her. I went. There were perhaps fifty people there. I\n",
      "have not the faintest idea who they were or what they looked like.\n",
      "Prestage--that was only one of his names, but it will do--asked\n",
      "immediately to be introduced to me, and we talked in a corner for an\n",
      "hour. Before we had talked for ten minutes I knew that the great gates\n",
      "were swinging open. It is not possible for a woman to define one man's\n",
      "fascination to another, and I hardly know myself why this man so\n",
      "completely turned my head. He was not exactly good-looking, but he had\n",
      "remarkable eyes and a singular tensity of manner, which made me almost\n",
      "breathless at times. He was, moreover, brilliantly educated and\n",
      "accomplished, and the most finished specimen of the man of the world I\n",
      "had met. He was an American of inherited fortune who had spent the\n",
      "greater part of his life in Europe, alternating between Paris and\n",
      "London, although he knew the society of other cities well enough. His\n",
      "contempt for the vulgarity of the huge modern fortunes, and his\n",
      "admiration for Munich, were the first subjects to discover to us the\n",
      "similarity of our tastes.\n",
      "\"We soon discovered others. I think he fell as deeply in love with me as\n",
      "he was capable of doing. He was forty-one and had fairly exhausted his\n",
      "capacity, for he had lived the life of pleasure only; but no doubt I was\n",
      "something new in his experience, and penetrated the ashes like a strong\n",
      "western breeze. I have seen him turn quite white when I suddenly\n",
      "appeared at one of our trysts.\n",
      "\"Of course I lived in a pension. I had no private sitting-room, and he\n",
      "positively refused to sit in the salon a second time. So we used to take\n",
      "interminable walks about Munich, lingering in all the quaint old Gothic\n",
      "corners, along the magnificent stretches of Renaissance; lunching on the\n",
      "terraces of the restaurants under the shade of the green trees, or in\n",
      "quaint little back gardens set in the angle of buildings as mediaeval as\n",
      "Rothenburg; the people looking down at us from the narrow windows or the\n",
      "little balconies. We spent hours in the Englischergarten, sitting on the\n",
      "banks of the Isar; often took the train to the beautiful Isarthal and\n",
      "spent the day in the woods; or sailed on one of the lakes with the\n",
      "tumbled glittering peaks of the Alps always in sight. We visited\n",
      "Ludwig's castles together, attended peasants' festivals in the\n",
      "mountains, lunching in some dilapidated old garden of a Gasthaus. And of\n",
      "course we went constantly to the opera. It was positive heaven for a\n",
      "time, and as romantic as the heart of any romantic idiot could wish. I\n",
      "was so happy I could not even think, even when I was alone. I simply sat\n",
      "like one in a trance and gazed into space, vague rose-colored dreams\n",
      "turning the slow wheel of my brain. No one paid any attention to us.\n",
      "Everybody in the pension was studying something; we avoided the American\n",
      "church and consulate and even the Baroness L. We were determined to have\n",
      "our blissful dream unvulgarized by gossip.\n",
      "\"There is no doubt that for a time my young enthusiasm gave him back a\n",
      "flicker of the romance of his own youth, but of course it couldn't last.\n",
      "I hardly know when it was I began to realize that the whole base of his\n",
      "nature was honeycombed with ennui, and that any structure reared upon it\n",
      "might topple at a moment's notice. I had been steeped to the eyes in the\n",
      "present. I had no wish to marry. Marriage was prosaic. Life was a fairy\n",
      "tale, why materialize it? I soon discovered that man's capacity for\n",
      "living on air is limited, and I had almost yielded to his entreaties to\n",
      "cross to England where we could marry without tiresome formalities, when\n",
      "one day--this was perhaps a month after we had met--he was late at a\n",
      "tryst. I lived a lifetime in five minutes. When he arrived he was so\n",
      "apologetic and so charming that if I had been an older woman I should\n",
      "have known that something was wrong. The next day, as it happened, I had\n",
      "to go to bed with influenza, and wrote him that I might not get out for\n",
      "a week. He wrote twice a day and sent me flowers. On the fourth morning\n",
      "I felt so much better that I sent him a note by a _dinstmann_ telling\n",
      "him that I should lunch on the terrace of the Neue Buerse restaurant. He\n",
      "was not awaiting me; nor did he come at all. Later I saw him driving\n",
      "with an astonishingly handsome woman; who looked as if she had been born\n",
      "without crudities or illusions.\n",
      "\"There are no words to express the tortures of jealousy and disgust that\n",
      "I endured that afternoon. But at five came a note stating that he had\n",
      "been out of town on a lonely voyage of discovery, and begging me to come\n",
      "for a cup of chocolate at the Cafe Luitpold--where we had gone so often\n",
      "to watch the motley crowd. I went, wrath and horror struggling in my\n",
      "heart with the sanguineness of woman. He had never been so charming and\n",
      "so plausible. I let him go on, exulting in the discovery that he was a\n",
      "liar, for I knew that it pushed me a step towards recovery. When he had\n",
      "finished I told him that I had seen him in the Hofgarten. I never shall\n",
      "forget how white he turned. But if he had been an adventurer his mind\n",
      "could not have been more nimble. He recovered himself instantly,\n",
      "admitted the impeachment, insisted that he had just returned when I saw\n",
      "him, had accepted a seat in the lady's carriage as he was entering his\n",
      "hotel--before he had time to go to his room and find my note. I knew\n",
      "that he was lying, but when he changed the subject to impassioned\n",
      "pleading that I would cross to England at once, I was forced to believe\n",
      "that he loved me.\n",
      "\"But I was miserably undecided. Moreover, I could not leave Munich. My\n",
      "quarterly remittance was unaccountably delayed. I told him this. He knew\n",
      "that I would not move without my own money, but he sent off several\n",
      "cables. The reply came that the drafts had gone and must have been lost\n",
      "in the mails. Duplicates would be sent. There was nothing to do but\n",
      "wait.\n",
      "\"I suppose that money enters into all things. It certainly ruled my\n",
      "destiny. The fortnight that ensued I never think of if I can help it. He\n",
      "was desperately bored with Munich, but too polite to leave me alone. I\n",
      "saw him with the woman three or four times. She was an Austrian who did\n",
      "not visit the Baroness L., and she was staying at his hotel. There was\n",
      "no doubt that he still wished to marry me, but I was in even less doubt\n",
      "that his ruined nature would yield more and more to this sort of\n",
      "fascination when my novelty had worn thin. Before my money arrived my\n",
      "mind was made up. I dared not trust myself to the seduction of his\n",
      "manner and voice--he was a past-master in the art of making love. I\n",
      "wrote him that I would not marry a man I could not trust, and fled to\n",
      "Vienna, telling my Munich bankers to keep my letters until I sent for\n",
      "them. For two weeks I travelled madly through Austria and Hungary. Never\n",
      "for a moment was I free of torments. Never before had I actually\n",
      "comprehended what love meant. I hardly ate or slept. I arrived at a\n",
      "place only to leave it. The hotel-keepers thought I was the American\n",
      "tourist overtaken by that final madness they had always anticipated.\n",
      "When the fortnight finished I looked back upon an eternity in purgatory.\n",
      "I surrendered; at least he loved me in his way. He had never ceased to\n",
      "urge our marriage. Who could say that I might not be fascinating enough\n",
      "to hold him? It was worth the trial, and I despised myself for laying\n",
      "down my arms without a struggle.\n",
      "\"I took the Oriental express from Budapest, but during the journey,\n",
      "swift as it was, I underwent certain reactions. I knew that he must have\n",
      "left Munich, that all I could do was to take a letter to his bank and\n",
      "ask that it be forwarded. I wrote the letter as soon as I arrived, but\n",
      "decided to post it; my pride revolted at facing the sharp eye of the\n",
      "person that handled the letters of credit. I had gone to the bank with\n",
      "Prestage more than once.\n",
      "\"As soon as the letter was posted I experienced a certain measure of\n",
      "peace, having done all I could. Nevertheless, to sit still was\n",
      "impossible, and I set out for a walk. It was one of those brilliant\n",
      "clear crisp days with which that high plateau can put even California to\n",
      "the blush. I saw that all the tram-cars were crowded, and that carriage\n",
      "loads of people had flower pieces. I asked if it were a Feiertag and was\n",
      "reminded that it was the 1st of November, All Saints' Day; Munich was on\n",
      "its way to the several cemeteries to decorate the graves. I had seen All\n",
      "Saints' Day in Venice and felt a mild curiosity to compare the Bavarian\n",
      "festival with the Italian. So I walked out to the great Alt Sud Friedhof\n",
      "where so many celebrities are buried, and where I fancied the scene\n",
      "would be most complete. When I arrived at the entrance the frames that\n",
      "had been set up in the outer court were almost denuded of the flower\n",
      "pieces the countrywomen had brought in to sell, but I bought a wreath at\n",
      "the solicitation of a peasant in a picturesque head-dress, and followed\n",
      "the crowd. The cemetery is on three sides of the entrance and enclosed\n",
      "by a high brick wall. I stood a moment at the inner official entrance,\n",
      "hardly knowing which way to turn; but seeing a number of staring people\n",
      "in a corridor on my right that faced one great division of the cemetery,\n",
      "I was turning into it mechanically when a policeman waved me back with\n",
      "the information that the entrance was at the other end. But not until I\n",
      "had seen, stared, and gasped. In an alcove was a figure, almost upright,\n",
      "that, in the first dazed seconds I took to be a wax-work, but\n",
      "immediately knew to be a dead woman. As I almost ran out I recalled that\n",
      "in Bavaria the dead are taken from the house within six hours, and are\n",
      "kept in a public mortuary for three days, or until all danger of\n",
      "premature interment is over.\n",
      "\"I do not think I should mind, particularly, seeing a ghost; I am sure\n",
      "my mental curiosity would get the better of my unwilling flesh; but I\n",
      "have a real horror of the corpse. I tried to forget the grotesque\n",
      "exhibition I had stumbled upon, in the novel and interesting scene about\n",
      "me. The long aisles of the cemetery were filled with well-dressed\n",
      "people, some strolling, others decorating, all apparently enjoying\n",
      "themselves. Almost all of the graves and monuments were bedecked, and\n",
      "presented a most Elysian appearance with the masses of bright flowers,\n",
      "the streamers of wide ribbon, the lighted lanterns, many of them antique\n",
      "and beautiful, above all the tall flambeaux, whose flames looked white\n",
      "and unearthly against the bright atmosphere. Above was a deep-blue sky\n",
      "with those thick low masses of snow-white clouds one sees only in\n",
      "Bavaria.\n",
      "\"But that grotesque little figure with its shrunken yellow face under\n",
      "the pitiless sun glare, its bony old hands, attached I knew, to the\n",
      "string of a distant bell, did not leave my mind for an instant. I walked\n",
      "down every path, I examined every interesting monument, I even went into\n",
      "the other divisions where there are so many statues in the alcove tombs;\n",
      "but all in vain. I felt that I should see that old woman to the end of\n",
      "my days. I could recall the very pattern of the cheap black lace of her\n",
      "cap. There was but one way to rid my mind of the obsession, and that\n",
      "was to return to the corridor, stand in front of every earthen figure,\n",
      "remain there until my mind was satiated, in consequence delivered.\n",
      "\"I set my teeth and went back to the Leichenhalle. Of course there were\n",
      "many to keep me company. I looked long and unflinchingly at two\n",
      "gentlemen in evening clothes, an old maid dressed for once on earth as a\n",
      "bride, a young woman and her infant. The coffins lay on an inclined\n",
      "plane and the edges were so concealed by a mass of flowers and greenery\n",
      "that the ghastly company looked as if half rising to hold a reception.\n",
      "\"And then I stood for I do not know how long before the alcove next to\n",
      "the old woman beside the exit, not knowing whether I were turned to\n",
      "stone or sitting by the Rosewater marsh indulging in some wild morbid\n",
      "flight of imagination.\n",
      "\"For there he was. For a second I did not fully recognize him, he was so\n",
      "yellow, his lower jaw had so hideously retreated, completely altering\n",
      "the slightly cynical expression of the mouth. The bright gay sunlight\n",
      "searched out every line carved by too much living, the little wrinkles\n",
      "about the eyes, the weakness of the handsome polished hands. He looked\n",
      "unspeakably aged and hideous. I had never dreamed that a brilliant mind\n",
      "could leave so miserable a shell behind it, that the body was such a\n",
      "mean poverty-stricken thing, a thing to be thrust out of sight as soon\n",
      "as it had fulfilled its work of balking and ruining the soul. I had\n",
      "never looked at Veronica after her death, and only once at my father,\n",
      "who had not horrified me, for here the undertaker has arts unknown,\n",
      "apparently, in Bavaria.\n",
      "\"My love died without a gasp. I shrank and curdled with horror that I\n",
      "had loved that hideous clay. What he had aroused in me was merely the\n",
      "response of youth to the masculine magnet, a trifle more specialized\n",
      "than I had heretofore encountered; the inevitable fever when infection\n",
      "appears. All personal feeling vanished out of me so completely that even\n",
      "while I stood there I felt the same pity for him that I had for the\n",
      "others, the helpless dead so mercilessly exposed to the vulgar\n",
      "indifferent crowd. If I could have hurried him into the privacy of the\n",
      "grave I would have exerted every effort, but before the laws of the\n",
      "country I was powerless. As I was leaving the cemetery I discovered that\n",
      "I still carried the wreath. I went back and added it to the bank of\n",
      "greenery which his valet no doubt had provided.\n",
      "\"When I returned to my pension I sent for the man and learned that he\n",
      "and the Consul-General of the United States had done all that the\n",
      "authorities had left in their hands. The body was to be shipped to New\n",
      "York within the month. He had died of Bright's disease. It had declared\n",
      "itself a day or two after I left. After ten days of intermittent\n",
      "suffering, during which the valet had felt no apprehension, he had died\n",
      "suddenly.\n",
      "\"I left Munich the same day. If I have failed to give you any adequate\n",
      "impression of my agonies, it will be next to impossible to describe my\n",
      "subsequent states of mind. Indeed I have little remembrance of my mental\n",
      "condition during the weeks of travel in Switzerland and Italy that\n",
      "followed. I was deliberately living up on the surface of my nature,\n",
      "indifferent to what was awaiting recognition below, although I knew it\n",
      "to be nothing unwelcome. Then, finally, I felt the time had come when I\n",
      "could draw aside the black curtain which I had hung for decency's sake\n",
      "between my consciousness and my depths, and tell the new guest to come\n",
      "forth. The guest was the liberty I had waited for all my life. I felt\n",
      "indescribably free, light, strong. The tyranny of love, even while it\n",
      "was but the love idea, that had shackled me for so many years, narrowing\n",
      "my interests, warping my imagination, clouding the future, was\n",
      "dissipated at last. I had paid the tribute to my youth and sex. I felt\n",
      "really alive for the first time, existing in the actual not in the dream\n",
      "world. There are women and women; and quite enough of the fine old\n",

      "themselves or life until they have worked through that necessary\n",
      "madness, buried it, and settled down to those infinite interests upon\n",

      "invited into a woman's crypts before, and he hardly knew whether he were\n",
      "gratified or repelled. She had been as brutally truthful as he would\n",
      "have expected her to be if she spoke at all, but he doubted if he\n",
      "understood her as well as he had expected. He had been assured that she\n",
      "had once at least possessed the capacity for intense feeling, but what\n",
      "was the result? And were the depths frozen solid? Or merely buried\n",
      "alive?\n",
      "He remarked after a moment: \"I cannot think of anything appropriate to\n",
      "say, so perhaps it is as well to say nothing. I certainly do not feel\n",
      "that you are in any need of my sympathies, for you are quite terribly\n",
      "strong. When did all this happen?\"\n",
      "\"About eight months before I went to England.\"\n",
      "\"What did you do with yourself in the interval?\"\n",
      "\"I climbed in the Alps a bit, then went to Rome and studied the\n",
      "Campagna, then travelled somewhat in Spain. By that time the desire for\n",
      "California had grown insistent. The novelty of Europe had worn thin. I\n",
      "was tired of playing at doing things, and only at home could I really\n",
      "accomplish anything. I suddenly made up my mind to pay the long-delayed\n",
      "visit to England, stopping in Paris by the way for frocks. I doubt if I\n",
      "ever enjoyed anything more than those three weeks in Paris, where I\n",
      "completely forgot every unpleasant association. It was my first fine\n",
      "wardrobe, my first opportunity to experience to the full the delight of\n",
      "clothes. I have felt quite happy here. California is so far from every\n",
      "other place that it is almost like living on a detached planet. You\n",
      "forget the rest of the world for months at a time. For days after I\n",
      "returned I wandered about out-of-doors in a gay irresponsible mood, and\n",
      "carolled all over the house. Of course it was nothing but the\n",
      "electricity of the climate and that I was in my own State once more and\n",
      "took an insane pride in it. You do not even need to be born here for\n",
      "that; it comes with the inevitable sense of isolation. You will feel it\n",
      "in time. If I had not known that so certainly I should never have dared\n",
      "to urge you to come.\"\n",
      "Gwynne smiled with a pardonable cynicism; but while he was not unwilling\n",
      "the conversation should turn upon himself, his curiosity was not\n",
      "satisfied. The fog had gone and the moon had risen. He could see Isabel\n",
      "quite plainly. She had turned her head and was gazing out over the great\n",
      "expanse desolated by the moonlight, and he studied her profile for the\n",
      "first time, often as he had observed it. To-night with the moonlight on\n",
      "it and against the dark hills it was almost repellently unmodern in its\n",
      "sharply cut regularity, the classic modelling of the eye-socket and\n",
      "chin, the nose with its slight arch. Her hair had fallen from its pins\n",
      "and hung in a braid, its length concealed by her position, and making\n",
      "the effect of a queue. She had long since taken off her hat and wrapped\n",
      "its veil about her head. The veil had slipped and might easily have been\n",
      "mistaken for a ribbon confining the queue at the base of the head. For\n",
      "an instant Gwynne's senses swam. He recalled the portraits of their\n",
      "Revolutionary ancestors in the house on Russian Hill. It might have been\n",
      "a medallion suspended before him. He drew in his breath; then his eye\n",
      "fell to the short thin sensitive upper lip, rarely quiet for all her\n",
      "extraordinary repose; to the full enticing under lip, and the little\n",
      "black moles. Then his gaze wandered down to the rough shooting-jacket,\n",
      "to the rubber boots reaching to her waist, and he only restrained\n",
      "himself from laughing aloud because he feared to rush down the curtain\n",
      "before that secretive nature.\n",
      "\"Then you have no faith in love as the best thing in the world?\" he\n",
      "asked.\n",
      "She turned upon him her clear dreaming eyes. \"I have faith enough in\n",
      "love, as I have faith in death, or any other of the uncontrovertible\n",
      "facts, as well as in its mission. But not as the best thing in life; not\n",
      "for my sort at least. Not for even the domestic, for that matter, unless\n",
      "they are utterly brainless. I believe that from the beginning of time\n",
      "the misery of the world has been caused by the superstition that love\n",
      "was all. It must continue to be the fate of the child-bearing woman, I\n",
      "suppose--for a while at least; but others have blundered upon the fact\n",
      "that it is a mere incident, and are far happier in consequence. To women\n",
      "like Anabel freedom means an indulgent husband and plenty of money. To\n",
      "others it means something of which the Anabels know the bare\n",
      "nomenclature: an absolute freedom of the soul, of which the outer\n",
      "independence is but the symbol. As I said, we only find it when we have\n",
      "finished with the bogie of love. It is a modern enough discovery. Think\n",
      "of the poor old maids of the generations behind us, who, failing to\n",
      "marry, collapsed into insignificance instead of revelling in their\n",
      "deliverance. And what humiliation to know that in your youth you are\n",
      "really wooed for the sake of the race alone, no matter what the\n",
      "delusions. If any one doubts it let him compare the matrimonial\n",
      "opportunities of the ugly maternal girl and the ugly clever girl. When\n",
      "clever women realize that they are a sex apart and wait until their\n",
      "first youth at least is over before selecting a companion of the sex\n",
      "that I am quite willing to concede must always interest us more than our\n",
      "own, and no doubt is necessary to our completion, then will the world\n",
      "have taken its first step towards real happiness.\"\n",
      "Gwynne repressed his gorge and answered practically: \"Not a bad idea if\n",
      "two were really suited, for no doubt companionship is _one_ of the best\n",
      "things in life, and a woman is more useful in many ways to a man than a\n",
      "partner of his own sex. It is even apparent that she does equally well\n",
      "in certain varieties of sport. I suppose the more experience a man has\n",
      "had of life the more he hesitates to define what love really is. One has\n",
      "attacks of such a severity and one recovers so completely! Doubtless\n",
      "Schopenhauer was right: it is merely the furious determination of the\n",
      "race to persist. Spencer tells us that it is 'absolutely antecedent to\n",
      "all relative experience whatever.' Companionship--yes--perhaps----\"\n",
      "\"It is necessary to a man; but by no means to all women----\"\n",
      "\"Not for yourself, you mean. You are still blunted and somewhat\n",
      "disgusted--\"\n",
      "\"I have dismissed the question. You cannot imagine how happy I feel\n",
      "every morning when I wake up, and every night when I go, always rather\n",
      "tired, into my comfortable little bed, knowing that I shall sleep like\n",
      "an infant. I love work. I love out-door life. I love the long evenings\n",
      "with my books and my thoughts, and my plans for the future--all my own.\n",
      "I revel in the thought that I can never be unhappy again, because now I\n",
      "love no one. I loved my poor father, and suffered with him in his fits\n",
      "of repentance and shame. I loved, of course, that man. I have absolutely\n",
      "nothing in common with Paula, and my mother is merely a pretty memory. I\n",
      "am fond of Anabel and perhaps several other friends--Mr. and Mrs.\n",
      "Leslie; but that sort of affection does not go very deep. Love is\n",
      "synonymous with selfishness and slavery--slavery because you no longer\n",
      "own yourself. My brother-in-law adores my sister, makes a great point of\n",
      "his fidelity, because before his marriage he was always flaunting some\n",
      "painted female, without which possession, a few years ago, a San\n",
      "Franciscan felt that he would lose the respect of his fellow-citizens.\n",
      "But Lyster's reform makes him as exacting as a Turk. If my poor silly\n",
      "little sister smiles at some fugitive thought he demands to know what it\n",
      "is, and if she cannot remember he sulks for a day. He would possess her\n",
      "very thoughts. She dares not have a man friend, talk to a man for half\n",
      "an hour at a time. He won't let her belong to a club--clubs are all very\n",
      "well for other women, but his wife is not as other women. On the other\n",
      "hand, he has long since let her persuade him that he is the most\n",
      "marvellous of men, and, in consequence, permits her to make every sort\n",
      "of mean little sacrifice while he spends his money on himself. Her eyes\n",
      "are in a measure open now, but it is too late, and she rebels in the\n",
      "usual futile feminine way. There are millions like them. You will meet\n",
      "Anne Montgomery. She is thirty-five now, quite plain, and makes a living\n",
      "as a sort of itinerant housekeeper and caterer. She was a most lovely\n",
      "girl, with a wild-rose complexion and starlike eyes, and full of life\n",
      "and buoyant hope. Her great talent was for the violin, and she dreamed\n",
      "of conquering the world. Teachers told her that with the proper study\n",
      "she could at least become a professional of the first rank, although she\n",
      "lacked the genius of creation. Her parents and an older sister--one of\n",
      "the plain, domestic, unselfish kind, whose pleasure is in living for\n",
      "others--were horrified at the bare suggestion. Not only because they\n",
      "were old-fashioned--some of the most old-fashioned people on earth are\n",
      "in San Francisco--but because it would mean separation from their idol.\n",
      "They surrounded her like a flaming belt, not even a man could get at\n",
      "her. They worshipped her as if she was a being of another world,\n",
      "devoured her; all the treasures of life were centred in her. That there\n",
      "might be the less temptation, they never took her to Europe; and\n",
      "gradually induced her to lay aside the instrument altogether. She was\n",
      "very sweet and gentle, and she loved them and submitted (I would have\n",
      "throttled them all). But she faded rapidly, lost her lovely coloring and\n",
      "animation, and she had no other beauty. Then her father speculated and\n",
      "failed. While they were undergoing real privations the influenza swooped\n",
      "down upon them and carried off the three older members of the family in\n",
      "a week. Anne Montgomery is the most conspicuous victim of what are\n",
      "generally supposed to be the higher affections that I know. They were\n",
      "just commonplace animals--those three--nothing more.\"\n",
      "\"Real happiness may lie in forgetting that love is selfish, and in\n",
      "overlooking the bitter in the sweet.\"\n",
      "Isabel shrugged her shoulders. \"If one can be happy without love why run\n",
      "the risks?\"\n",
      "They felt that they had exhausted the subject for the present and there\n",
      "was a long silence. Gwynne's eyes wandered over the inexpressibly\n",
      "desolate and sinister landscape. The intense brilliancy of the moon\n",
      "seemed to press darkness down upon the earth. It was true that every\n",
      "object was as sharp of outline as if cut against crystal, but they were\n",
      "a hard dark brown: the hills that jutted out into the windings of the\n",
      "marsh, the marsh itself, the more distant mountains. It looked like a\n",
      "landscape upon which the sun had set for ever, smitten with death--or\n",
      "not yet born into the solar system; some terrible formless menacing\n",
      "globe on the edge of the Universe. As he had approached San Francisco on\n",
      "the afternoon of his arrival, standing on the forward deck of the boat\n",
      "in a high wind, he had thought it the most stranded lonely city he had\n",
      "ever seen. He recalled the impression now, and in a flash he appreciated\n",
      "the Californian's attitude to the rest of the world, the effect of such\n",
      "isolation upon the character of a people that had created a great and\n",
      "important city out of the wilderness, and in half a century. In spite of\n",
      "the obstinate aloofness of his ego he felt an involuntary thrill of\n",
      "pride in his connection with such a people; and hoped it might be\n",
      "premonitory. But again the eerie landscape claimed him and he became\n",
      "aware of the weird night sounds that broke out with violent abruptness\n",
      "after intervals of throbbing quiet: the loud honk-honk of geese, the\n",
      "shriek of loons, the noisy capricious serenade of the frogs. He\n",
      "experienced a feeling of such utter isolation that he almost started\n",
      "when Isabel spoke.\n",
      "\"These waste places in California are almost terrifying by moonlight,\"\n",
      "said she. \"They always look as if they were brooding, crouching,\n",
      "concentrating their energies for a convulsion. No earthquake country can\n",
      "be quite normal in any of its aspects, nor quite beautiful. Here comes\n",
      "the tide. How Mac will grumble at us! But he is sure to have kept the\n",
      "fire going, and you shall have a cup of hot coffee before you start for\n",
      "home.\"\n",
      "XII\n",
      "Gwynne, on the following day, was making a late toilet, and in anything\n",
      "but a good-humor, for he had grown accustomed to early rising, when he\n",
      "received a note from Isabel.\n",
      "It ran:\n",
      "DEAR PARTNER,--Anabel has just told me over the telephone that Tom\n",
      "and Mr. Leslie and two other representative citizens are going out\n",
      "to see you this afternoon. I have the ghost of an idea that a\n",
      "friendly call is not their only object. _Do_ be plastic--it is\n",
      "better in the beginning--until you know your ground. Above all,\n",
      "don't be too English. You are vastly improved, but you have lapses.\n",
      "I send you your share of the ducks. Mariana's roasting will explain\n",
      "our pride in one of the two most native of our products--the next\n",
      "time we go to San Francisco I'll take you to the market and we will\n",
      "sit in a grimy little balcony restaurant and you will be introduced\n",
      "to fried California oysters.\n",
      "Please consider the marsh your own; and whenever you come, remember\n",
      "that you are to have breakfast or supper with me. Are you quite\n",
      "comfortable? If anything is wrong I will go over and interview\n",
      "Mariana and the Jap. Of course the latter will appropriate your\n",
      "cigarettes and books; he is probably a prince, and far from\n",
      "condescending to steal, he will take them as his right; and his\n",
      "hauteur may match your own at times. Moreover, he may decamp any\n",
      "morning without giving notice--Lafcadio Hearn dwells upon the\n",
      "_impermanency_ of the Japanese, and we can all bear him out. But on\n",
      "the other hand the Jap will keep your house cleaner than any other\n",
      "sort of servant, and he can be both amiable and alert when he\n",
      "chooses. I merely warn you, for I know nothing of your present\n",
      "_homme de chambre_ beyond the recommendation of my Chuma, who is\n",
      "amiable to the verge of imbecility. If he disappears, let me know\n",
      "at once, for I really want to make you comfortable and contented in\n",
      "what I know must seem to you little more than a beautiful\n",
      "wilderness peopled by ambitious barbarians. But wait till you know\n",
      "San Francisco!\n",
      "ISABEL.\n",
      "Gwynne smiled at the form of address and the expressions of concern in\n",
      "his welfare; but he scowled twice over the admonition to be plastic and\n",
      "American.\n",
      "\"I'll be what I damn please,\" he announced, aloud, much to the surprise\n",
      "of Imura Kisaburo Hinomoto who entered at the moment with his shaving\n",
      "water.\n",
      "Nevertheless, when his visitors arrived, late in the afternoon, his\n",
      "natural courtesy, and the reflection that he had not come to America to\n",
      "fail, induced him to receive the four with something like warmth, and to\n",
      "place his cigars and whiskey--he already knew better than to offer them\n",
      "tea--at their immediate disposal. They sat on the porch facing the\n",
      "mountain, and for a few moments the conversation was confined to the\n",
      "weather and the scenery, giving Gwynne an opportunity to observe his\n",
      "guests with some minuteness. Judge Leslie and young Colton he had\n",
      "already met, and he liked the former, a pleasant shrewd tactful man, who\n",
      "was one of the chief ornaments of the northern bar, and universally\n",
      "admitted to be \"dead straight.\" So \"straight,\" indeed, was he that his\n",
      "term of judgeship had been brief. He had been carried to the bench on an\n",
      "independent ticket, but the reform movement subsiding, he could obtain\n",
      "re-election only by bargaining with political bosses, and this he\n",
      "refused to do; but after the fashion of the country he retained his\n",
      "title. He had a loose hairy benignant face with a humorous but\n",
      "penetrating eye and the usual domelike brow. His body had grown unwieldy\n",
      "from years and lack of exercise, and his clothes were old-fashioned and,\n",
      "generally, dusty. He voted the Republican ticket and was not too well\n",
      "pleased with his son-in-law who was a red Democrat and rising daily in\n",
      "the good graces of the party bosses.\n",
      "This young man who was sipping his plain soda and commenting on neither\n",
      "the scenery nor the weather, had inspired Gwynne with a certain interest\n",
      "and curiosity. He was thirty but looked little over twenty, and his\n",
      "large limpid blue eyes were as guileless as a child's. He had a long\n",
      "pale face with an indifferent complexion and the common American lantern\n",
      "jaw. His hair and brows and lashes were paler than straw, and his long\n",
      "lank figure was without either distinction or muscularity. Nevertheless,\n",
      "there was a curious suggestion of cynical power in his impassive face\n",
      "and lolling inches, and Gwynne had made up his mind that he would be\n",
      "useful as a study in politics.\n",
      "Mr. Wheaton, one of the present \"City Fathers,\" a position he had\n",
      "occupied with brief intermittences for many years, had hard china-blue\n",
      "eyes and a straight mouth, in a large square smoothly-shaven face. He\n",
      "had crossed the plains in the Fifties from the inhospitable State of\n",
      "Maine, sought fortune in the gold diggings with moderate success,\n",
      "avoided San Francisco with a farmer's dread of \"sharpers,\" and drifting\n",
      "to the hamlet at the head of Rosewater Creek had opened a small store\n",
      "for general merchandise. Frugality and a shrewd knowledge of what men\n",
      "wanted and women thought they wanted had increased his capital so\n",
      "rapidly that in five years he had converted a wing of the store into a\n",
      "bank. To-day he was a power. His wife was the leader of Rosewater\n",
      "society and attended first nights in San Francisco.\n",
      "Mr. Larkin T. Boutts was new to Gwynne, although his status was easily\n",
      "to be inferred from the constant references in the local press. He was a\n",
      "fat little man who sat habitually with a hand on either knee, which he\n",
      "clawed absently both in conversation and thought. Otherwise his attitude\n",
      "was one of extreme repose, even watchfulness. He was excessively neat,\n",
      "almost fashionable in his dress, which--Gwynne was to observe in the\n",
      "course of time--was invariably brown. He had a small pointed beard and a\n",
      "sharp direct dishonest eye. He was the leading hardware merchant of\n",
      "Rosewater and owned the hotel and the opera-house. His business methods\n",
      "had never been above criticism, and his politics drove the San Francisco\n",
      "correspondent, during legislative sittings, into a display of caustic\n",
      "virtue which gave the newspaper he represented just the necessary smack\n",
      "of reform and did not hurt its inspiration in the least. For Mr. Boutts\n",
      "was too sharp for the law, and all his sins were forgiven him on account\n",
      "of his genuine devotion to Rosewater. Far from battening on her, after\n",
      "the fashion of the San Francisco cormorant, he had never taken a dollar\n",
      "out of her that he had not returned a hundred-fold, and he was the\n",
      "author of much of her wealth.\n",
      "This gentleman was the first to indicate that they had not driven out\n",
      "to Lumalitas to discuss the weather and the scenery.\n",
      "\"Best come to business,\" he said, abruptly. \"Judge, will you do the\n",
      "talking?\"\n",
      "But Judge Leslie, who was a modest man, waved his hand deprecatingly.\n",
      "\"The idea is yours, sir, and yours is the right to state the case.\"\n",
      "The host hastily poured whiskey-and-soda lest he should look haughtily\n",
      "expectant.\n",
      "\"It's just this, Mr. Gwynne,\" began Boutts, in his suave even tones. \"We\n",
      "have seen your ads. We know that you contemplate selling off a good part\n",
      "of your ranch--Well, there was a buzz round town when those ads were\n",
      "read, and I was not long passing the word that there would be a\n",
      "mass-meeting that night in Armory Hall. That's where we thresh things\n",
      "out, and in this case there was no time to lose. We had a pretty full\n",
      "meeting. Judge Leslie took the chair, and I opened with some of the most\n",
      "pointed remarks I ever made. I was followed with more unanimity than\n",
      "usually falls to my lot. The upshot was that resolutions were passed\n",
      "before nine o'clock, and a committee of four was appointed to wait upon\n",
      "you to-day--and endeavor to win you to our point of view,\" he continued,\n",
      "suddenly lame, for by this time Gwynne, forgetting Isabel and his good\n",
      "resolutions, was staring at the common little man with all the arrogance\n",
      "of his nature in arms, and the color rising in his cheeks. Mr. Boutts's\n",
      "hands gripped his knees as if for anchorage, and he proceeded, firmly:\n",
      "\"No offence, sir, I assure you. This is a free country. The man who\n",
      "tells another man what he'd orter do should be called down good and\n",
      "hard. Nothing could be further from our intention. The meeting was\n",
      "called only in the cause of what you might call both self-defence and\n",
      "patriotic local sentiment, although it's a sentiment that's local to\n",
      "about two-thirds of California--only we do more acting and less talking\n",
      "than most. It's now some weeks since we adopted resolutions in a still\n",
      "bigger mass-meeting and got the best part of the county to subscribe to\n",
      "them; on the ground that an ounce of prevention and so forth. So we just\n",
      "hoped that as you have come to live among us you could be brought to see\n",
      "things from our point of view.\"\n",
      "He scraped his chair forward and dropped his voice confidentially, at\n",
      "the same time darting a sharp glance through the open window beside him.\n",
      "\"It's this Japanese business. The Chinese, back in the Seventies, was\n",
      "not a patch on it, because the Chinee never aspired to be anything but\n",
      "house servants, fruit pickers, vegetable raisers and vendors on a small\n",
      "scale, and the like. The agitation against them which led to the\n",
      "exclusion bill was wholly Irish; that is to say it was entirely a\n",

      "unreliable you never know where you are with them. And being servants is\n",
      "about the last ambition they've come for to this great and glorious\n",
      "country. They're buyin' farms all up and down the rivers, the most\n",
      "fertile land in the State, to say nothing of some of the interior\n",
      "valleys. You see, there were big grants like Lumalitas at first over a\n",
      "good part of California. Then the ranches of thousands of acres were cut\n",
      "up and sold into farms of three or four hundred acres that paid like the\n",
      "mischief so long as the old man stuck to business himself. This he\n",
      "generally did; but times have changed, and now all the young men want to\n",
      "go to town; and most of the big farms have been cut up into little ones\n",
      "and sold off to immigrants and the like. Well, that's the Japs' lay.\n",
      "They like things on a small scale and know how to wring a dollar out of\n",
      "every five-cent piece. No one's denying they're smart. They slid in and\n",
      "got a good grip before we thought them worth looking at. Now we're\n",
      "saddled with about thirty thousand of them, and more coming on every\n",
      "steamer from Honolulu and Japan. Some years ago when they began to find\n",
      "themselves as a nation, and to rebel at the foreigners that were ruling\n",
      "things through the open ports, they let it be pretty well known that it\n",
      "was going to be Japan for the Japanese. Well, now the sooner they know\n",
      "that it's California for the Californians the better it will be for all\n",
      "hands. We don't go round lookin' for trouble, but if it comes our way we\n",
      "don't mind it one little bit. We'll tolerate the Japs just in so far as\n",
      "we find them useful, and useful they are as servants; for if they don't\n",
      "hold a candle to the old Chinee, they're a long sight better than our\n",
      "lazy high-toned hired girls, who are good for just exactly nothing; and\n",
      "we need a certain amount of them for hire in other fields; but as\n",
      "citizens, not much. We've put a stop to that right here, in this county\n",
      "at least; and so, Mr. Gwynne, that's the milk in the cocoanut, and we\n",
      "hope that you'll see things our way, and not sell any of your land to\n",
      "the Japs.\"\n",
      "\"You see,\" interposed Judge Leslie, that Gwynne might not feel himself\n",
      "rushed to a decision. \"These little men, while possessing so many\n",
      "admirable traits that I am quite willing to take off my hat to them, are\n",
      "not desirable citizens in a white man's country. Not only is their whole\n",
      "view of life and religion, every antecedent and tradition, exactly\n",
      "opposed to the Occidental, so that we never could assimilate them, never\n",
      "even contemplate their taking a part in our legislation nor marrying our\n",
      "daughters, but--and for the majority of the people this is the crux of\n",
      "the whole matter--commercially and industrially they are a menace. With\n",
      "their excessive frugality they can undersell the most thrifty white man,\n",
      "both as farmers and merchants; and the contempt they excite,\n",
      "particularly in this state of extravagant traditions, is as detrimental\n",
      "in its effects as their business methods; the more a man exercises his\n",
      "faculty for contempt the more must his general standards sink toward\n",
      "pessimism, and pessimism is neither more nor less than a confession of\n",
      "failure in the struggle with life. I never was much of a fighter, so I\n",
      "believe in eliminating the foe whenever it is possible. At all events we\n",
      "have made up our minds to eliminate the Jap, what with one motive and\n",
      "another, and I think we will. It may come to war in time--when the\n",
      "United States are ready--but we Californians have a way of taking\n",
      "matters into our own hands, and as war is a remote possibility, and we\n",
      "have little prospects of legislation--what with the treaty and the\n",
      "unpreparedness of the country for war--we just do what we can to freeze\n",
      "the Japs out. If we must have small farmers and our own young men have\n",
      "other ambitions, there are plenty of good European immigrants, and it\n",
      "is our business to encourage them. We assimilate anything white so\n",
      "quickly it is a wonder an immigrant remembers the native way of\n",
      "pronouncing his own name. But the Oriental we can't assimilate, for all\n",
      "our ostrich-like digestion, and what we can't assimilate we won't have.\n",
      "It is also true that we don't like the Jap. He antagonizes us with his\n",
      "ill-concealed impertinence under a thin veneer of servility; and\n",
      "superior as he is, still he has a colored skin. Now, right or wrong,\n",
      "Christian or merely natural, we despise and dislike colored blood, every\n",
      "decent man of us in this United States of America. Your sentimentalists\n",
      "can come over and wonder and write about us, reproach us and do their\n",
      "honest ingenuous best to convert us, it never will make _one damned bit\n",
      "of difference_. We are as we are and that is the end of it. The\n",
      "antagonism, of course, only leaps to life when the colored man wants\n",
      "equal rights and recognition, something he will never get in the United\n",
      "States of America, as long as the stripes and the stars wave over it;\n",
      "and the sooner the sentimentalists quit holding out false hopes the\n",
      "better. As to the Chinese, it is quite true that there was no objection\n",
      "to them outside of politics. And the reason was, they kept their place.\n",
      "The antipathy to the Japanese extends throughout all classes. Every\n",
      "thinking man in the State is concerned with the question. California\n",
      "will be overrun with them before we know where we are; and we are hoping\n",
      "that other counties will give an ear to the wisdom and farsightedness\n",
      "Mr. Boutts has displayed, in proposing that no more land shall be\n",
      "sold--or rented--to the Japanese. They can work for us if we have need\n",
      "of them, for a while, but they cannot settle.\"\n",
      "Gwynne had been thinking rapidly as Judge Leslie drawled out his\n",
      "homily. In his new apprehension of latent weaknesses in his character he\n",
      "was indisposed to yield to pressure, but he was equally desirous not to\n",
      "let the turmoil into which his inner life had been thrown lead him to\n",
      "any ridiculous extremes; not only interfering with his prospects, but\n",
      "converting himself into chaos. He was extremely anxious to make no\n",
      "mistakes at the outset of his new career, beset with difficulties\n",
      "enough. Their words had every appearance of being a just presentment of\n",
      "a just cause. He didn't care a hang about the \"Jap.\" For the matter of\n",
      "that, he reflected with some bitterness, he didn't care a hang about\n",
      "California. At this point in his reflections he became aware that Colton\n",
      "was turning his head with a sort of slow significance. He looked up and\n",
      "watched a pale eyelash drop over a deep gleam of intelligence. Mr.\n",
      "Leslie finished speaking, and Gwynne replied with an elaborate\n",
      "politeness, which might be his vehicle for spontaneous sympathy or utter\n",
      "indifference.\n",
      "\"Thank you all very much for your confidence in me, and also for\n",
      "preventing me from making what no doubt would have been a serious\n",
      "mistake. I have no desire whatever for the Japanese as a neighbor. I was\n",
      "one of the few to recognize the menace of Japan to Occidental\n",
      "civilization when all the world was sympathizing with it during its war\n",
      "with Russia, and they will get no encouragement from me. So the matter\n",
      "is settled as far as I am concerned.\"\n",
      "\"Shake!\" said Mr. Wheaton, in a deep rumbling voice.\n",
      "The four shook hands solemnly with their new neighbor, then, with even a\n",
      "greater gusto, drank his health. Gwynne suddenly remembering the\n",
      "California tradition, and the ducks, invited them to remain for supper;\n",
      "but all declined except Colton, who sent his wife a message by his\n",
      "father-in-law. The other three climbed into Judge Leslie's surrey and\n",
      "departed, Colton remarking, apologetically, and somewhat wistfully:\n",
      "\"She's dining at the judge's and won't miss me: I never leave her alone.\n",
      "I'll get back in time to take her home.\"\n",

      "Mariana cooked the ducks with the skill of the unsung _chef_ she was,\n",
      "and enhanced them with other delicacies for which she alone had a name.\n",
      "Gwynne, faithless to Isabel's crude though honest effort, rose to gayety\n",
      "and wondered whether California was practising the insidious methods of\n",
      "the wife. Colton, absent of eye, disposed of his share of the repast as\n",
      "negatively as he did most things, and as soon as they had retired to the\n",
      "veranda produced a bag of peanuts from his pocket, without which, he\n",
      "remarked, no meal was complete. Gwynne declined the national delicacy,\n",
      "feeling that diplomacy had its limits, and lit a pipe, wondering how he\n",
      "should lead his new friend to give him some practical political\n",
      "information. He detected the guile under that bland, almost vacant\n",
      "exterior, and Colton's prattle about duck-shooting and deer-hunting,\n",
      "although apparently endless, did not divert him for a moment. But he had\n",
      "less trouble than he had anticipated. Colton's mind seldom roved far\n",
      "from politics, and it required little tact to lead him to the trough.\n",
      "\"As I am necessarily in your confidence I will take you voluntarily into\n",
      "mine,\" he announced, in his clear high pipe. \"I don't in my heart care a\n",
      "hang more for the Democratic party than I do for the Republican. But the\n",
      "Republicans own the State at present, and there's no chance to get your\n",
      "name up and really do things in that party. They're out for graft, every\n",
      "last one of them. The chance is on the other side. It's a big chance;\n",
      "for the laboring class, what with unions, and being rotten spoilt with\n",
      "easy living in this State, is becoming more and more dissatisfied every\n",
      "day. If they were let alone it would never occur to them they weren't\n",
      "the chosen of the Lord; but we--the Democratic party--can't afford to\n",
      "let them alone, unless we want to go out of business altogether. They\n",
      "are just about the only dough we've got to work on, and for the last few\n",
      "years we've been systematically sowing the seeds of discontent by means\n",
      "of the press, metropolitan and local, abusing the rich, the trusts,\n",
      "harping on the segregation of capital by a favored few, to the unjust\n",
      "and illegal impoverishment of the many, painting gaudy pictures of what\n",
      "the working-man's lot will be when he gets his rights, emphasizing that\n",
      "in this State, of all others, man was intended to be happy and share\n",
      "equally in her abundance. We sail pretty close to anarchy; but they are\n",
      "an ignorant foolish lot, and we keep a tight hand on the reins and will\n",
      "drive them in a straight line when the time comes. I am qualifying for\n",
      "the position of district leader hereabouts, although I'm not announcing\n",
      "it from the house-tops. But the present one is getting old, and I'm on\n",
      "the inside track. I dress in these battered old clothes, that make my\n",

      "impress the farmers what a good Democrat I am; not a bit like Hyliard\n",

      "that he can move to San Francisco. But I drive round in a dusty old\n",
      "buggy, with candy for the children in my pocket, and chin with the\n",
      "farmers about the crops and any old thing. When this county turns\n",
      "Democratic, as it shall in the next five years--likely as not sooner, we\n",
      "have so much raw material to work on in these immigrants--I intend to go\n",
      "to Congress, hold on in the House until there is a vacancy in the\n",
      "Senate, and there I'll be for life, and the boss of this State to boot.\n",
      "I can't say I care about the Presidency. It's only a chance that there\n",
      "may be anything doing while you're in--it's largely luck--and then when\n",
      "you're out, if you survive the White House--which most Presidents\n",
      "don't--you're as good as dead. I don't care about going abroad as a\n",
      "Consul-General, or even Ambassador, for I wouldn't hold any office under\n",
      "the United States government that was dependent upon the favor of a\n",

      "never know where you are. Political enemies at home, liars abroad,\n",
      "somebody with a little more influence, or any low political business,\n",
      "and you're fired without being heard in your own defence. You've got no\n",
      "redress, and may be disgraced for life without ever knowing where you\n",
      "were hit. None of that for me, although I'd like a big position of that\n",
      "sort for my wife. But she can cut all the dash she wants as a senator's\n",
      "wife, and I'll wield the big stick. That's where the fun comes in. I\n",
      "have a natural turn for politics, and then it's the only road out of\n",
      "Rosewater. The old gentleman is dead set upon my succeeding him in the\n",
      "bank, and he'd never give me a lift, although if I made a hit at\n",
      "anything he'd be so proud it would be easy sailing after. He's not a bit\n",
      "displeased that I've turned over a few thousands an aunt left me. But\n",
      "I'm after bigger game than that. She also left me two thousand acres of\n",
      "land, that look hopeless because there's not so much as a spring on\n",
      "them, and they're in one of the droughtiest sections in the State--she\n",
      "got them as a bad debt. Now, just over the border of that ranch is a big\n",

      "few hundreds in a few hungry pockets, and we run a snake through the\n",
      "legislature declaring that lake state property. Then I ditch from the\n",
      "lake, and I am the proud owner of a large tract of valuable irrigated\n",
      "land. I sell off in small farms, and clean up a hundred thousand\n",
      "dollars. That I'll invest in a Class A building in San Francisco. I'm\n",

      "I'll build a house on Connecticut Avenue in Washington, and my wife\n",
      "shall have dresses four times a year from Paris.\" He turned to Gwynne\n",
      "with glowing eyes. \"You've barely seen her--and you haven't had a sight\n",
      "of the kids. She's Isabel's great friend. I wonder you haven't been\n",

      "be glad to see you.\"\n",
      "Gwynne thanked him absently; then, while his guest, dismissing politics,\n",
      "indulged in domestic rhapsodies, relating several anecdotes the while he\n",
      "consumed another bag of peanuts, Gwynne's brain worked rapidly. He\n",
      "boiled with discouragement and disgust. The cynical frankness of this\n",
      "young provincial, with his serene confidence in his star, and in his\n",
      "power to handle the millions he despised, bore a primitive and\n",
      "humiliating likeness to his younger self: Americanized by the lower\n",
      "standards of his country perhaps, but painfully like in its elements.\n",
      "All he could claim, it seemed to him at the moment, was a higher\n",
      "personal sense of honesty and honor; and how long would he keep it in\n",
      "this country? While he was hesitating between taking a possible rival\n",
      "into his confidence, and an arrogant desire to announce his reason for\n",
      "coming to California, without regard to consequences, Colton dropped the\n",
      "subject of his family, scattered the mass of shells on the floor with a\n",
      "sudden sweep of his foot, and tipping his chair back against the wall,\n",
      "produced a large red apple and his pocket-knife.\n",
      "\"I can't say that I like the seamy side of politics,\" he remarked,\n",
      "absently, as he performed a delicate operation without breaking the\n",
      "skin. \"My wife always maintains that I'm the most honest man alive, and\n",
      "I shouldn't wonder if that was the way I really was made. Anyhow, I know\n",
      "I'd a heap sight rather do a man a good turn than an ill one; but when\n",
      "he gets in your way what are you going to do in a country where politics\n",
      "are machine-made and every cog has to be oiled with graft? I'm thankful\n",
      "I'll never be forced to accept a bribe--there's a lot of difference\n",
      "between giving and taking, and I guess I'll have to do a lot of the\n",
      "first. But it's politics or nothing with me, aside from having a natural\n",
      "genius for them. I'll never get out of Rosewater otherwise. My father is\n",
      "likely to live for twenty years yet, and I hope to God he will; but I\n",
      "want the big game while I'm young. If the country was better I'd be,\n",
      "too, and like my job. But you've got to play the game in your\n",
      "shirt-sleeves. Kid gloves, and you sit on the fence and watch somebody\n",
      "else wallow in after the prizes.\"\n",
      "\"It seems to me that the best chance for fame and power lies in that\n",
      "superior strength which is allied with honesty. A man who is at the same\n",
      "time a clever manipulator of men, and whose aim is statesmanship, should\n",
      "be able to reach his goal by a clean road.\"\n",
      "Gwynne had been long enough in the United States to blush uneasily as he\n",
      "delivered these sentiments, and his color deepened as Colton gave a\n",
      "little snort.\n",
      "\"Can't be done. Not in this State, anyhow. You've been talking to\n",
      "Isabel. She looks like the Pilgrim Fathers and has inherited all their\n",
      "antiquated notions. Honest, now--_are_ your politics so much better than\n",
      "ours?\"\n",
      "\"A long sight. And they are by no means perfect. We have our machine and\n",
      "our compromises, and all the rest of it; and even a few wholly rotten\n",
      "boroughs. Fifty years ago we were blatantly worse than you are to-day.\n",
      "As long as the game lasts, and there are two parties, there must be more\n",
      "or less chicanery, but we are snow-white compared with the mire of this\n",
      "country. And it is an anomaly I cannot understand. I have now been a\n",
      "year in the United States, have talked with hundreds of Americans,\n",
      "studied them and their institutions. Few have struck me as personally\n",
      "dishonest--as we interpret the word in England. Human nature in this\n",
      "country, indeed, has at times appeared to me almost elemental, utterly\n",
      "without the subtlety that makes for crooked dealing. There is a thousand\n",
      "times more petty trickery in Europe; and, with us, more hypocrisy,\n",
      "certainly; but politics we have at least elevated. Here, the best man in\n",
      "private life seems to become transformed the moment he enters the\n",
      "political atmosphere, and if he is not a scoundrel, he sails pretty\n",
      "close to the wind.\"\n",
      "\"H--m! All you say may be true. I don't agitate my gray matter over\n",
      "problems. I know what we are, and the work cut out for me if I want to\n",
      "stay on top. I have known reformers. We have lots of spasmodic attempts\n",
      "at reform right here in this district. When the reform is directed at\n",
      "some glaring evil, something that makes us uncomfortable, then it goes\n",
      "through. When it's directed against politics in general, then the\n",
      "reformer falls so hard he never gets up--unless, to be sure, he\n",
      "scrambles up p. d. q. and trims with the wind. And that, I'm bound to\n",
      "say, he generally does. We've had our idealists--talk till your mouth\n",
      "waters. One session in Sacramento generally cures them. When it doesn't,\n",
      "we have no more idea what becomes of them than of an ant that butts in\n",
      "on a procession of other ants. Ever watch ants?\"\n",
      "It was Gwynne's turn to snort.\n",
      "\"I take my boy up on the hills every Sunday afternoon when it is fine,\n",

      "is too high and mighty. She's a wonderful girl all right, but the last\n",
      "woman I'd want for a wife. I know a girl that would just suit you--Dolly\n",
      "Boutts. She's as pretty as a peach, and as domestic as Anabel. I'll have\n",
      "you both in to supper, as soon as we get a new cook. We've had four this\n",

      "could trust himself to articulate. Colton, munching his apple, and\n",
      "twirling the long spiral of skin he had peeled off without a break,\n",
      "detected nothing unusual in the atmosphere. It was characteristic of him\n",
      "that he took no interest in his new friend's future. Isabel had told him\n",
      "that Gwynne had not sufficient income to maintain his rank in England,\n",
      "and had resolved not only to drop his titles, but the name by which he\n",
      "had so long been known; being averse from notoriety. Colton, who had\n",
      "barely recalled the name of Elton Gwynne--he usually skipped the\n",
      "telegrams unless a war with picturesque details monopolized the foreign\n",
      "columns--had been somewhat amused at the precaution, but respected it;\n",
      "he would never have thought of betraying a confidence reposed in the\n",
      "bank. He assumed that Gwynne intended to become a rancher, like so many\n",
      "other Englishmen, and that he purposed reading law merely as a secondary\n",
      "occupation. He could have thought of several more interesting methods of\n",
      "putting in time; but every one to his taste.\n",
      "Gwynne spoke finally, and when he did, Colton, whose chair was still\n",
      "tipped against the wall, sat forward with a square planting of his feet.\n",
      "\"I came to California with one intention only,\" said Gwynne: \"to have\n",
      "the political career that my elevation to the peerage deprived me of in\n",
      "England. I had intended to work with the Democratic party, but I am free\n",
      "to state that your account of it has turned my stomach. My reasons for\n",
      "selecting it were, partly, that in principle at least it more nearly\n",
      "approached the Liberal party in England; partly because of its weakness\n",
      "in strong men. But if it is as rotten as you say I am afraid it would be\n",
      "a waste of time to qualify for it; I certainly could not work in\n",
      "harmony with it. However, there is an abundance of time for close\n",
      "observation. I cannot vote for four years, and if I finally decide in\n",
      "favor of the Republican party, at least we shall not be rivals.\"\n",
      "\"_Jiminy!_\" exclaimed young Colton, ingenuously; but Gwynne could see\n",
      "the glitter of his eye. \"Well, I'm glad to hear it. Not much you don't\n",
      "go over to the Republicans! There isn't five cents' worth of choice\n",
      "between the two parties when it comes to a square deal on any measure\n",
      "ever put up, and this slow wave of reform that's trying to crawl over\n",
      "the country--against trusts, graft, and the like--is just strong enough\n",
      "to swamp the Republicans and give us our chance. Rivals! Not a bit of\n",
      "it. There's room for all, and you're just the man we want. Isabel told\n",
      "me you were a wonderful speaker--I'd forgotten. That's _just_ what we\n",
      "want. I can't speak for a cent. There's no one in the district that can\n",
      "carry a crowd. The boss was wailing over it the other day. You can do a\n",
      "lot in the next four years. You'll go to all the conventions and county\n",
      "meetings with me and make my speeches. I'll introduce you to everybody\n",
      "that can put you _on_. You've fallen into clover with the judge, because\n",
      "his only son, who was practising with him, has had to go to southern\n",
      "California to live--nerves all broken up. He'll push you all right, and\n",
      "as soon as you have swallowed the California codes you can practise in\n",
      "the courts by courtesy. Then I'll take you to Sacramento with me next\n",
      "year--I'm a senator this term--as my private secretary, and you'll learn\n",
      "a lot. Your hair will stand up straight, but never mind. All that will\n",
      "pave the way for whatever office you want to begin with when your papers\n",
      "are ripe. I'll see that it's a good conspicuous town or county office,\n",
      "and the legislature will follow as a matter of course. That will fill in\n",
      "while you are waiting a chance for Congress--you must be seven years in\n",
      "the country for that--nine for the Senate. Only, you must swallow us\n",
      "whole. You can't make us over. We Democrats are determined to get on top\n",
      "again and have our chance at the pickings. We'll talk reform, of course.\n",
      "That's where your eloquence will come in, and the more you believe in it\n",
      "while you're holding forth about the Republican party robbing the widow\n",
      "and orphan--more particularly the farmer and the laborer--the better.\n",
      "We'll promise the working-man a sort of sugar-coated socialism, but we\n",
      "won't inspire him with any higher ideals than pecuniary profits, _if you\n",
      "please_. That would mean content, and the end of the Democratic party.\n",
      "Well, think it over. I must go. My little old woman doesn't like to sit\n",
      "up late. Mind you drop in and see her the next time you are in town.\"\n",
      "Gwynne rang for his guest's buggy, thanked him for his advice; then\n",
      "ordered his horse and rode about the ranch half the night.\n",
      "XIV\n",
      "A fortnight later Isabel announced to Gwynne that she intended to give a\n",
      "party and introduce him to the young people of Rosewater.\n",
      "\"All the girls want to know you, Anabel tells me, and as it is a relief\n",
      "to hear that they are interested in something besides cards, and as\n",
      "nobody else seems disposed to take the initiative, I have concluded to\n",
      "play the _grande dame_ for a night. In a way it is my duty to introduce\n",
      "you formally, although it would be more so if they had done anything for\n",
      "me since my return. However--I will ask them for next Saturday evening\n",
      "if you have nothing better to do.\"\n",
      "\"One day is quite the same as another to me,\" said Gwynne, dryly. \"What\n",
      "do you fancy are my evening engagements? I have not even begun to read\n",
      "law with Mr. Leslie; he has gone off to southern California to see his\n",
      "son. He says he is always restless in the autumn, as young people are in\n",
      "the spring, but has promised me his attention before the middle of this\n",
      "month.\"\n",
      "They were rowing down the channel of the wider portion of the creek\n",
      "towards Isabel's landing, their boat filled with spoil. The little\n",
      "steamboat was winding proudly through the marsh, there were a dozen\n",
      "sails in sight; from the south came an incessant sound of firing. The\n",
      "distant mountains looked as hard as metal and there was a new crispness\n",
      "in the air. Little rain had fallen, but it was no longer summer. Gwynne\n",
      "had exchanged his khaki riding-clothes for corduroy; and Isabel's habit,\n",
      "although still dust-colored, was made of cloth instead of pongee. To-day\n",
      "they wore light covert coats over their canvas and rubber.\n",
      "With the passing of the heat and the advent of the daily electric\n",
      "breezes sweeping up the valleys from the sea, Gwynne felt a slow lifting\n",
      "of the dead weight on his spirits, although he was only happy when he\n",
      "had his gun in his hand. California seemed less like a voluptuous\n",
      "leviathan blowing poppy-dust that blunted the memory of all things\n",
      "beyond her borders. At first he had been vaguely uneasy at the insidious\n",
      "suggestion that he had transferred himself to another planet, but he was\n",
      "beginning to suspect that California, true to her sex, might have\n",
      "surprises in store that would quicken his blood at least. He still\n",
      "disliked her at night: the high unfriendly arch of her sky, the sinister\n",
      "atmosphere that brooded over her spaces, suggesting illimitable reaches\n",
      "where no man dwelt, or would long be tolerated. But her days seemed full\n",
      "of promise, and they certainly were full of beauty.\n",
      "He still fought with a longing to confide in Isabel: his apprehensions\n",
      "and doubts, his haunting interrogation of inherent greatness. But he\n",
      "turned from the temptation in a panic of spirit, sure that he would fail\n",
      "unless he fought his battle alone. He had pondered more and more upon\n",
      "his possible debt to his mother; and the doubt that she might have been\n",
      "the foundation of his courage and self-confidence was as bitter as that\n",
      "he might have owed the extraordinary rapidity of his career to the\n",
      "influence of his family and name. And Isabel's very strength alarmed\n",
      "him, the more so as he felt her subtle fingers among the leaves of his\n",
      "new destiny. So he merely smiled into her eyes and made a gallant\n",
      "remark, a purely masculine method of emphasizing that woman is charming\n",
      "in her proper place.\n",
      "\"I shall be delighted to dance again; particularly--it seems odd--as I\n",
      "have never danced with you. And it is a year since I have seen you in an\n",
      "evening gown. I have a vivid remembrance of how you looked that night at\n",
      "Arcot, when you turned so many heads.\"\n",
      "Isabel colored, and whether with pleasure or resentment, she had not the\n",
      "least idea. But she answered, hastily:\n",
      "\"I feel that I have been very selfish to do nothing before. But really,\n",
      "it seemed hopeless until Anabel told me yesterday that there was a vast\n",
      "amount of interest in the young English rancher. I am afraid the girls\n",
      "here will not interest you; only you should have the opportunity of\n",
      "deciding that question for yourself. But what will be really delightful\n",
      "will be to show you San Francisco. I have not been able to leave the\n",
      "ranch for a day since that three weeks' outing I had no business to\n",
      "take. But I have had half a dozen resentful letters from Paula, who has\n",
      "persuaded herself that you are her cousin too, and asserts her right to\n",
      "know you. But neither she nor Lyster has the remotest suspicion of your\n",
      "identity. Elton Gwynne might have a dozen brothers; nor is it likely\n",
      "they ever heard the name. If you were an artist or actor or litterateur\n",
      "or composer you might be as well known in San Francisco as in London.\n",
      "There is no city in the United States one-half so artistic--nor so given\n",
      "to fads. But in European politics, the young people, at least, take as\n",
      "much interest as they do in the canals of the moon. So you are quite\n",
      "safe, and Lyster is the man of all others to show you Bohemian San\n",
      "Francisco and give you a thoroughly good time. We might go down a few\n",
      "days after the party.\"\n",
      "\"That will be very jolly. I will confess that although San Francisco did\n",
      "not inspire me with enthusiasm, it has occurred to me that it might be\n",
      "an improvement on Rosewater.... Oh, by-the-way, I had a letter from my\n",
      "mother not long ago, in which she said she had met some San Franciscans\n",
      "at Homburg--Hofer, I believe the name was--and had promised I should\n",
      "call on them, mentioning me, of course, as John Gwynne. I have wondered\n",
      "if the risk would be worth while. The amusement to be derived from\n",
      "provincial society is very doubtful.\"\n",
      "\"Provincial! What arrogance! Do please call on the Hofers. They have the\n",
      "old Polk house, whose history I have told you, and entertain like\n",
      "princes. Besides, Mr. Hofer is one of that small millionaire group that\n",
      "is trying to clean up San Francisco municipally. He is quite worth\n",
      "knowing. And I want you to know San Francisco. It is my ambition to be a\n",
      "great figure in San Francisco--and I have seen other cities, and might\n",
      "be enjoying myself in England this moment.\"\n",
      "\"Yes, I know,\" said Gwynne, smiling, and admiring her pink cheeks and\n",
      "flashing eyes. \"And of course I don't forget that you have spurned a\n",
      "great position for the sake of your beloved city. That is really at the\n",
      "root of my desire to know the place. If it has a fascination I should\n",
      "like to feel it. Fascination is a strong word and means a considerable\n",
      "amount of enjoyment, up to a certain point. But I am glad to have heard\n",
      "the declaration of your ambition. Is it the final one?\"\n",
      "\"It is the pedestal,\" said Isabel, enigmatically. \"Sometime, when you\n",
      "give me your confidence, I will give you mine.\"\n",
      "\"I have no confidences to make--none, at least, that can compare with\n",
      "the rich experiences of your past. I told you all about Mrs. Kaye before\n",
      "I left England, and, so far, America has left me--well, unfascinated.\n",
      "By-the-way, Colton informs me that he and his wife have picked out some\n",
      "one to cheer my loneliness and--\"\n",
      "\"Who?\"\n",
      "\"I do not remember her name. Doubtless she will be at the party. I am\n",
      "curious to see all your friends together. I have seen an astonishing\n",
      "number of pretty girls in the street, and I am wondering how they will\n",
      "stand the test of lighting up; the great test to my mind. I don't know\n",
      "which I like least, the manufactured animation of the European woman of\n",
      "the world, or the too natural animation which makes the American girl's\n",
      "features dance all over her face. You, if you don't mind my saying so,\n",
      "are one of the very few Americans I have met that has something of the\n",
      "Englishwoman's faculty of looking, at the same time, statuesque and\n",
      "glowingly alive.\"\n",
      "\"You excite my suspicion: I see no indication that you are out of\n",
      "practice. It is quite true that American women's faces, like their\n",
      "voices, lack cultivation. Well, you will see a good many pretty girls on\n",
      "Saturday night, and with no particular advantage of dress. Money has\n",
      "nothing to do with social position in these country towns. Perhaps\n",
      "twenty families besides the bankers and Mr. Boutts, and the Leslies, are\n",
      "well off. But many girls who are in the best society earn their living:\n",
      "typewriters, clerks, book-keepers, and the like. One has carried on her\n",
      "father's drug-store since his death. Most of the young men that could\n",
      "get away have gone, and there are not half a dozen left with any money\n",
      "behind them. The majority of beaux are either clerks, or in some small\n",
      "business, although there are always the doctors and clergymen--very few\n",
      "young lawyers. Snobbery barely exists. There are lines, but purely\n",
      "theological. All social groups centre about the churches. The first here\n",
      "has always been the Episcopalian.\"\n",
      "\"It had occurred to me that society of any sort had ceased. Of the\n",
      "famous California hospitality I have seen nothing. A number of men have\n",
      "driven out and called upon me, and I have returned their calls, and\n",
      "found their houses very well appointed--although some member of the\n",
      "family usually answered the bell; and one morning I saw Miss Wheaton\n",
      "sweeping off the porch, her head tied up in a towel. All I meet appear\n",
      "to be very cordial and friendly, but I have not been asked to take so\n",
      "much as a cup of tea in a house in the county, and I have now been here\n",
      "something like five weeks.\"\n",
      "\"California hospitality is a mere legend except in San Francisco. In the\n",
      "small communities it has never existed in my time, although they used to\n",
      "dance a good deal before cards turned their heads. You will find just as\n",
      "much haggling over a five-cent piece here as in any small New England\n",
      "town. These rich men have made their money by hoarding and wary\n",
      "investments, rarely speculating; and that tells immensely on the\n",
      "character. I doubt if the State itself has ever known the meaning of\n",
      "hospitality since the old ranch days, when, of course, it was prodigal.\n",
      "It is the San Franciscans that have kept the tradition alive; they are\n",
      "as reckless, as extravagant, as royally indifferent to mere money as in\n",
      "the famous Fifties. If you happen to call too close to a meal-time in\n",
      "one of these towns, the meal will be postponed until you leave. In San\n",
      "Francisco they would give you two-thirds of their last crust. At the old\n",
      "Rosewater dances we never had anything but cake and lemonade--ice-cream\n",
      "in very hot weather. I think it would be a good idea to give them a\n",
      "shock and have a supper from town.\"\n",
      "\"I believe you are socially ambitious,\" said Gwynne, smiling. \"No doubt\n",
      "it is your intention to make a fortune and lead San Francisco society.\"\n",
      "\"Perhaps, but not in the way you mean.\"\n",
      "XV\n",
      "The long-closed bar-room of Old Inn was aired for a week, denuded of\n",
      "cobwebs, delivered of mice, canvassed by the invaluable Chuma. The\n",
      "Rosewater Hotel promised to contribute its Sunday band of four pieces,\n",
      "manipulated with no mean skill by worthy but unprosperous young\n",
      "citizens. Not one of Isabel's invitations was refused. The girls\n",
      "suddenly discovered that they were still young, and were as much excited\n",
      "at the prospect of a night's dancing as at meeting the English rancher.\n",
      "The men accepted as a matter of course, thankful to be asked to\n",
      "anything. The older people, surprised at an invitation to a dance,\n",
      "assured one another that Isabel Otis, being absurdly extravagant, and\n",
      "living two miles out in the country, was almost certain to regale her\n",
      "guests with fried oysters and ice-cream. One or two of her mother's old\n",
      "friends wrote and offered to contribute a chocolate cake, but were\n",
      "relieved when she refused to \"trouble them.\" Gwynne and Isabel hung the\n",
      "walls of the big room with palm leaves, and branches covered thick with\n",
      "small yellow oranges, the first of the year. When they rested from their\n",
      "labors Isabel declared that it looked like an exhibit at a county fair,\n",
      "but Gwynne, never having attended a county fair, was proud of his\n",
      "handiwork and thought the effect an improvement upon the average\n",
      "ballroom. The day before the party Tom Colton and Hyliard Wheaton rode\n",
      "out to Lumalitas and demanded of Gwynne if he intended to wear a\n",
      "\"claw-hammer.\" Colton was averse on principle from being too \"swagger\";\n",
      "and they finally compromised on what the Americans called their\n",
      "\"Tuxedos,\" and Gwynne his \"smoker.\" Anabel Colton, Dolly Boutts, and\n",
      "Serena Wheaton, after half a day's telephoning, decided to \"wear their\n",
      "necks,\" and their hostess agreed to keep them in countenance. Every team\n",
      "in Rosewater was bespoken for the distinguished occasion, and the\n",
      "reports of the weather bureau were consulted daily. But the rains held\n",
      "off and the night of the party was brilliant with starlight, and not too\n",
      "cold.\n",
      "Gwynne, who had no intention of receiving with Isabel, and learning from\n",
      "Colton that everybody would have arrived before nine o'clock, did not\n",
      "make his appearance until ten. He found the big room full of young and\n",
      "elderly people, even the latter chattering with an extraordinary\n",
      "animation, induced no doubt by the surprises that had greeted them; they\n",
      "had forgotten the existence of the old bar-room. From the dancers Gwynne\n",
      "received a general impression of pink cheeks, fluffy hair, delicate\n",
      "features, gay simple gowns, the usual lack of background; a curious\n",
      "transientness, as if they had been born for the night like summer moths.\n",
      "The men for the most part made a good appearance, the more favored\n",
      "looking college-bred and irreproachable. Hyliard Wheaton, who was really\n",
      "handsome, with his broad shoulders and cool smooth well-cut face, wore\n",
      "an orchid in his button-hole and was devoting himself to Isabel.\n",
      "The hostess wore a gown of black chiffon trimmed with pale blue that\n",
      "looked simple and was not. Her neck and arms were bare, and Gwynne\n",
      "noticed at once that she had another little black mole where the bodice\n",
      "slipped from her shoulder. She reproached the guest of honor for being\n",
      "late.\n",
      "\"You will dance this waltz with me,\" she commanded, royally; \"and then I\n",
      "will introduce you to the prettiest of the girls.\"\n",
      "For the first time in his life Gwynne felt self-conscious in putting his\n",
      "arm about a woman's waist for the waltz. He had seen Isabel in full\n",
      "evening dress many a time in England, in rubber boots to her hips, in\n",
      "divided skirt astride her horse, in overalls among her chickens, and in\n",
      "pretty little house-gowns when he had remained for supper; nevertheless,\n",
      "in surrendering her slim waist she seemed to descend, significantly,\n",
      "from her pedestal and become warm flesh and blood. He held her\n",
      "awkwardly, barely touching her, wondering there should be physical\n",
      "shrinking from such a beautiful creature, one, moreover, that had shown\n",
      "him more kindness and disinterested friendship than any he had ever\n",
      "known. He reproached himself, but even while he admired the luminous\n",
      "whiteness of her skin he found himself scowling at the tiny black moles\n",
      "that gave her an oddly artificial provocative look, as black patches may\n",
      "have deliberately enhanced the charms of their coquettish grandmothers.\n",
      "\"Humph!\" said Mrs. Wheaton, raising her lorgnette, as became a leader of\n",
      "society. \"He is not so fond of her, for all this friendship we have been\n",
      "hearing so much about. Well, it is natural enough. Isabel is far too\n",
      "independent to be really attractive to men, for all her good looks.\n",
      "These advanced women will have to step aside into a class by themselves,\n",
      "and as the men won't follow them, that will mean they will die off\n",
      "naturally, and the world wag its own old way once more.\"\n",
      "She was a tall stout woman, with a pale heavy face, and a curious\n",
      "elevation of nose, as if sniffing an unpleasant odor; but which was\n",
      "really meant to express pride of carriage. She wore a somewhat\n",
      "old-fashioned but handsome gown of lavender satin trimmed with point\n",
      "lace about the bodice, and a pair of diamond ear-rings. On one side of\n",
      "her sat the elder Mrs. Colton, in black silk with a point-lace collar; a\n",
      "sweet-faced frankly elderly woman. The third member of the group was a\n",
      "woman who might have been any age between thirty-five and fifty, very\n",
      "thin and dark, with the curiously virginal look peculiar to childless\n",
      "women tainted by a suggestion of morbid sensuality, very difficult to\n",
      "locate. Sometimes it seemed to twist across her thin restless mouth, at\n",
      "others to gleam from her deep-set black eyes with a fleeting wildness.\n",
      "Ordinarily she was smiling with an affected cynicism, and it was plain\n",
      "to be seen that she respected her intellect. She was abominably dressed\n",
      "in a frock of purple merino trimmed with black velvet ribbon; but she\n",
      "wore a gold comb in her hair and a diamond brooch.\n",
      "As the leader finished her remarks Mrs. Haight brought her teeth\n",
      "together with a snap and shot through them a little hiss. Mrs. Wheaton\n",
      "turned upon her with the gleam of the bird of prey in her little gray\n",
      "cold eyes. All the gossip of Rosewater was very old, scandal rare. \"What\n",
      "is it, Minerva?\" she asked, eagerly. \"Are they engaged? And do you know\n",
      "just why he has come out here?\"\n",
      "\"I only know what everybody says about his coming here--that his health\n",
      "ain't good, and he wants to make the ranch pay by running it himself;\n",
      "but that other--\" She paused and lifted her thin shoulders\n",
      "significantly. \"Well, all I can say is, that if they ain't engaged they\n",
      "ought to be.\"\n",
      "Mrs. Wheaton leaned forward eagerly, but Mrs. Colton said, severely:\n",
      "\"That is just your evil mind, Minerva. You are always imagining things;\n",
      "comes of having nothing to think about but cards and novels--six\n",
      "children were what you needed.\"\n",
      "\"I guess I have as much as anybody to think about, what with having no\n",
      "help half the time, and a husband who wants his meals on time whether or\n",
      "no. And I guess I worked as hard in the City Improvement Club as anybody\n",
      "until we got all those concrete sidewalks for the town, let alone the\n",
      "parks. What if I do read novels and play cards for recreation? Too much\n",
      "thinking ain't good for anybody.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, never mind,\" interrupted Mrs. Wheaton, hastily. \"But what did you\n",
      "mean, anyhow?\"\n",
      "\"Well, as you know, I don't sleep very well, and I often get up and sit\n",
      "at the window, watching for the boat 'bus, and just imagining where the\n",
      "people who are out late, or up early, are going to and what they are\n",
      "thinking about. Well, I've seen him\"--jerking her shoulder at Gwynne,\n",
      "who was now dancing with Miss Boutts--\"I've seen him riding home from\n",
      "here as late as ten or half-past, many a night. He may have been\n",
      "duck-shooting and stayed to supper. That's all right, but he could go\n",
      "home just after. I for one don't think it's decent--a girl living all\n",
      "alone like she does. If he wants to shoot ducks, anyhow, why don't he\n",
      "join a club? If he does all his shooting here it's to be with her, and\n",
      "no mistake. I've said from the very first, it's downright indecent for a\n",
      "girl to live alone on a farm--no chaperon, not even a woman servant. I,\n",
      "for one, think that Isabel Otis has done just as she pleased long\n",
      "enough, and ought to be called down.\"\n",
      "\"It is only natural that she should do as she pleases now that she has\n",
      "the chance, poor soul,\" said Mrs. Colton. \"She never had anything but\n",
      "trouble and sorrow in her life until James Otis died. I wish he could\n",
      "have died when she was little and I could have brought her up. That\n",
      "life, and then her sudden liberty, have made her independent and\n",
      "advanced, but I can't say that I like it myself. I wish she were more\n",
      "like Anabel. It's odd they're not more alike, being such friends.\"\n",
      "\"I quite agree with Minerva!\" announced the leader. \"Isabel ought to\n",
      "have a chaperon. I don't doubt she's all she should be or _I_ shouldn't\n",
      "be here to-night, friend of her mother's or not; but I suggested to her\n",
      "only yesterday--I had a little talk with her on Main Street--that she\n",
      "get some respectable old maid or widow to live with her.\"\n",
      "\"What did she say?\" asked Mrs. Colton, with a smile.\n",
      "\"Say? The insolent young minx! She just looked at me, through me--Me--as\n",
      "if I had not spoken. Her mother always put on airs. That's where she\n",
      "gets it from. I had half a mind not to come to-night. But I wanted to\n",
      "see things for myself. If she does anything really imprudent, _I'll make\n",
      "her suffer_.\"\n",
      "This last phrase was famous in Rosewater. Mrs. Wheaton employed it\n",
      "seldom, but when she did her friends understood that she was not far\n",
      "from the war-path. Her color had risen with the memory of yesterday's\n",
      "grievance, pushed aside by curiosity for some twenty-eight hours.\n",
      "Mrs. Haight regarded the radiant young hostess with a malignant stare,\n",
      "prudently veiled by drooping lids. She envied Isabel with her whole\n",
      "small soul; she had never known the sensation of liberty in her life,\n",
      "and she stopped short of the courage that might snatch it. Mr. Haight,\n",
      "the leading druggist of Rosewater and an eminent and useful citizen, was\n",
      "a large stolid elderly man--he was at present in the little dining-room\n",
      "with other gentlemen of his standing and a punch-bowl--as regular as a\n",
      "clock in his habits, and devoted conscientiously to his wife, whom he\n",
      "took for a buggy ride every Sunday in fine weather. They had been\n",
      "married for twenty-two years, and for at least fifteen she had yearned\n",
      "to be the heroine of an illicit romance; nor ever yet had found the\n",
      "courage to indulge in a mild flirtation. She really loved her husband,\n",
      "and in many respects made him an excellent wife, but her depths were\n",
      "choked with the slime of a morbid eroticism which her husband was the\n",
      "last man to exorcise. The earlier fever in her blood had gradually\n",
      "dropped to the greensickness of middle-age, so that she was vaguely\n",
      "repellent to men, particularly the young. This she had the wit to\n",
      "detect, as well as the incontrovertible fact that her youth and her\n",
      "chances were gone. As a natural consequence her repressed but still\n",
      "rebellious passions diffused their poison throughout her nature. There\n",
      "were times when she was seized with a frantic desire to inflict injury\n",
      "upon some other woman, and at all times she found relief in sharp\n",
      "criticism, in flinging mud at mantles spotless to the casual eye. She\n",
      "passed for being very piquante and clever in a town where so little\n",
      "happened except the turning over of money, and where the conversation\n",
      "alternated between chickens and cards. She was sure that she scented a\n",
      "scandal here, and her very nostrils quivered with anticipation; the\n",
      "while she hated Isabel more bitterly for taking a lover instead of an\n",
      "eternal husband.\n",
      "\"Looks as if she didn't mean to introduce him to us,\" she remarked, with\n",
      "an attempt at frigid criticism. \"He don't dance so well but what the\n",
      "girls could get on without him. Isabel might give him a chance to\n",
      "exhibit his conversational powers--My! if he ain't going to dance again\n",
      "with Dolly Boutts! I'd like to know how Isabel fancies that!\"\n",
      "Gwynne, who liked any sort of exercise, and had been reading the United\n",
      "States Statutes the greater part of the day, danced with the girls to\n",
      "whom Isabel introduced him, returning no less than three times to the\n",
      "exuberant Miss Boutts, whose step suited his, and whom he thought one of\n",
      "the prettiest girls he had seen in America. Mr. Boutts's mother had been\n",
      "the daughter of an Italian restaurant keeper in San Francisco, and his\n",
      "heiress inherited a fine flashing pair of black eyes, a mass of black\n",
      "hair, and a voluptuous but buoyant figure. She had inherited nothing of\n",
      "the languor and fire of the Italian race, but chattered as incessantly\n",
      "as any American girl, and had the mind and character of sixteen, in\n",
      "spite of her almost full-blown beauty. Having an instinct for dress in\n",
      "addition to a liberal allowance from her father, she was always a\n",
      "notable figure in Main Street; and when in San Francisco was pleasantly\n",
      "aware that she was by no means unnoticed in the fashionable throngs of\n",
      "the hotels and Kearny Street. To-night she wore a gown of black net\n",
      "revealing her superb shoulders and arms, and bunches of red carnations\n",
      "that emphasized the red of her full pouting lips. She danced with a\n",
      "graceful energy and looked unutterable things out of her great black\n",
      "eyes while talking of the weather. Gwynne thought her a creature of\n",
      "infinite possibilities, beside whom Isabel was a statue in ivory.\n",
      "Just before supper he was introduced to the older women, and offered his\n",
      "arm to Mrs. Wheaton when two waiters, unmistakably from a San Francisco\n",
      "caterer, threw open the doors upon a hall that separated the ballroom\n",
      "from the old hotel dining-room. The startled guests filed hastily across\n",
      "to find a dainty but sumptuous repast served at little tables. Even the\n",
      "ice-cream was frozen in graceful shapes instead of being ladled out of a\n",
      "freezer in full view of the company, and there was such an abundance of\n",
      "all things, served with despatch by the professional waiters, that Mrs.\n",
      "Haight was permitted to consume three plates of oysters _a la poulette_.\n",
      "\"This must have cost a pretty penny!\" she muttered to Mrs.\n",
      "Wheaton--Gwynne was dancing attendance on Miss Boutts once more. \"Much\n",
      "money she'll save! One would think this was San Francisco, and some\n",
      "swell house on Nob Hill. I don't believe a thing was cooked in her own\n",
      "kitchen.\"\n",
      "\"I should think not! This supper is from the St. Francis, or The Palace,\n",
      "or The Poodle Dog--\" Mrs. Wheaton ran off the names of all the famous\n",
      "San Francisco restaurants, to the ill-concealed spite of Mrs. Haight who\n",
      "did not dine in San Francisco once a year. \"But as you suggest, I cannot\n",
      "imagine how she expects to make a fortune in chickens if she throws\n",
      "about money like this. No wonder Mr. Gwynne isn't good enough for\n",
      "her--but perhaps that's the reason he's selling off so much of his\n",
      "ranch. Mr. Wheaton says he thinks of putting up an office building on\n",
      "some land he has south of Market Street.\"\n",
      "\"To my way of thinking, Isabel Otis and matrimony don't gee. She's\n",
      "altogether too advanced. Just you wait.\"\n",
      "The young people, meanwhile, were very gay, and there was little doubt\n",
      "in Isabel's mind that if she lived in Rosewater and chose to revive and\n",
      "lead the old social life she could drive cards to the wall in the first\n",
      "engagement. She had been much elated with her success, but, of a sudden,\n",
      "as her eyes roved benignantly over her chattering delighted guests,\n",
      "ennui descended upon her: those ancestral mutterings in the soul that\n",
      "stir dim memories of great moments of a greater time, inviting a vague\n",
      "contempt and distaste for the petty incidents and achievements that make\n",
      "up the sum of life. Isabel had experienced this faint sensation of\n",
      "futility and disgust many times before, and although she was wise enough\n",
      "not to let it paralyze her will, and to turn it to account in holding\n",
      "her to her higher ideals, still she often envied the Dolly Bouttses,\n",
      "with good red plebeian blood in their veins, and no voices in the\n",
      "subconscious brain but those that bade them eat and drink and feed the\n",
      "race. No, she decided, Rosewater could work out of its present inertia\n",
      "by itself, and she began to wish her guests would go home; she was tired\n",
      "of their inanities. Her disappointment in Hyliard Wheaton, whom she had\n",
      "admired from a distance ever since her return, but who had never\n",
      "succumbed to her charm until to-night, had much to do with her sense of\n",
      "futility. He had read nothing, seen nothing, experienced nothing. He had\n",
      "no ambition beyond living in San Francisco and enjoying life there. His\n",
      "fine well-bred face with its high brow and smiling, slightly superior,\n",
      "gaze, had suggested--the more particularly, perhaps, as his figure was\n",
      "superb--possibilities both intellectual and romantic. Isabel told him\n",
      "politely never to ride out without using the telephone first, and had\n",
      "her excuses already coined. At least ten men be sides Gwynne were\n",
      "hovering about Dolly Boutts, like humming-birds about the nectar of a\n",
      "full-blown rose. They were blind to the fact that her voluptuous\n",
      "suggestion was but a caprice of nature. Although, no doubt, she would\n",
      "make the best of wives and mothers, she was as incapable of any depth of\n",
      "passion as the frail fluffy creatures about her, and quite indifferent\n",
      "to anything in man beyond his admiration. Up to the present she had\n",
      "found cards far more interesting, particularly as she had known all the\n",
      "Rosewater men since childhood; more particularly, perhaps, as this was\n",
      "her first large party. She chattered, partly by instinct, partly in\n",
      "deference to the traditional animation of the American girl; and it was\n",
      "quite likely that the ultimate man would lead her to the altar under the\n",
      "delusion that she was a brilliant woman with a genuine temperament.\n",
      "Isabel wondered somewhat contemptuously at Gwynne's evident enthusiasm;\n",
      "she would have given him credit for more experience and perspicacity;\n",
      "but concluded that at a party a man could only judge a girl by her\n",
      "exterior charms; and certainly Dolly had all her goods in the front\n",
      "window.\n",
      "After supper they danced the old Virginia reel with great zest, and even\n",
      "a few stray waltzes, then all left together at two o'clock; the older\n",
      "women assuring Isabel formally that they had had a very pleasant\n",
      "evening; but the girls and young men exclaimed that they had had a keen\n",
      "time, a dandy time, and that their new hostess was too fine and dandy\n",
      "for words.\n",

      "Judge Leslie returned on the following day, and, sending for Gwynne at\n",
      "once, announced that he was ready to settle down for the winter. A\n",
      "partner attended to the business of the office, and the judge shut\n",
      "himself up with Gwynne in the large light room containing his fine law\n",
      "library, and examined his promising pupil. Gwynne was well read in the\n",
      "English Common Law, and in Comparative Jurisprudence, particularly in\n",
      "the history of treaties and the comity of nations. So much he had\n",
      "regarded as necessary to the education of a future cabinet minister.\n",
      "Judge Leslie sketched out a course of study which embraced Cooley and\n",
      "Kent on Constitutional Law, compilations of Leading Cases, Story on\n",
      "Contracts, the California Codes, Civil, Penal, and Political, and\n",
      "Corporation Law. \"The money is in the last,\" he remarked, dryly, \"but\n",
      "even if you never succumb to these monstrous corporations, more aptly\n",
      "named cormorants, the more you know about their methods and needs the\n",
      "better, should you ever be called upon to fight them; and I have an idea\n",
      "that that is just where you will show your strength. All the great\n",
      "statesmen of this country have been great lawyers, and the great\n",
      "statesman of the future is going to be the lawyer that checks the power\n",
      "of unscrupulous capital, without at the same time delivering the country\n",
      "over to the mercies of that equally unscrupulous tyranny the\n",
      "labor-union. There is a solution somewhere and some man is going to find\n",
      "it. I don't see why you should not be the man. I have followed your\n",
      "career very carefully--you have always interested me. You come here with\n",
      "a magnificent political training, a mind uncorrupted by a lifetime of\n",
      "contact with the contemptible methods of machine politics, and a really\n",
      "great ambition. Your eyes are wide open. I don't see why you should make\n",
      "any mistakes, particularly as you have four good years in which to\n",
      "ponder the great question before committing yourself. Four years are a\n",
      "long span. No man can tell what may happen in that time, what new party\n",
      "may evolve. All you can do is to watch events and be ready for the\n",
      "forelock when time shakes it at you. If it so happens that you can\n",
      "insidiously mould a new party meanwhile, so much the better. The wisest\n",
      "and most suggestive writer on our national life is a Briton. I see no\n",
      "reason why England should not send us a statesman--in the old sense. God\n",
      "knows, all that we have now are a bitter disappointment to those of us\n",
      "with any of the old ideals left. Should the Presidency be your ambition,\n",
      "the fact of your having actually been born on American soil may be the\n",
      "cause of a legal battle in the Supreme Court of the United States that\n",
      "will pass into history. Meanwhile, as all apprenticeships must be\n",
      "humble, you will be a sort of unofficial junior of this firm, sharing\n",
      "the office business for the first year with Cresswell, and the second\n",
      "year helping me with court practice in St. Peter. You can read in the\n",
      "intervals and at home, and once or twice a week I should advise you to\n",
      "attend lectures at the State University. I can see that your memory and\n",
      "powers of assimilation are very vigorous, and the more quickly you\n",
      "imbibe, and the more varied the quality, the better. All the odd types\n",
      "of human nature you meet in this office won't do you any harm, either.\n",
      "Study the American character above all things. Get in sympathy with it.\n",
      "It is as opposite from the English as pole from pole, but you won't find\n",

      "circumstances have forced them into the hands of a class of men that\n",
      "make their living out of them, and whose natural destiny was\n",
      "pocket-picking and the Rogues' Gallery--and if the best of us combine\n",
      "one day to do you honor, we can carry you to places as distinguished as\n",

      "The judge wound up his homily with a little peroration on Abraham\n",
      "Lincoln and then left Gwynne to the California codes. The large new\n",
      "stone office building of which Judge Leslie was the chief tenant stood\n",
      "at the corner of a street a block above Main; Gwynne glancing over the\n",
      "top of his tome could see a procession of teams, men lounging in the\n",
      "doorway of a grocery store, and the spars of fishing-boats waiting for\n",
      "the tide. His mind played him a curious trick. Piccadilly was before him\n",
      "with its great hotels, its splendid old stone houses upon which the fogs\n",
      "and the grime of London had demonstrated their poetical mission, the\n",
      "classic entrance to the Park, the crowds of smart men and women;\n",
      "Piccadilly at eight on a summer's evening choked with broughams and\n",
      "hansoms, in which the light mantles barely concealed the shoulders and\n",
      "jewels of the women. He had loved the outside life of London, returning\n",
      "to it from afar with an ever fresh and boyish pleasure, the keener\n",
      "perhaps because he knew that all doors were open to him and that he was\n",
      "one of the great lions, not of those for whom the stranger must search\n",
      "\"Who's Who\" upon his return from a function where half the guests had\n",
      "made their little mark. He saw the lofty towers with their delicate\n",
      "tracery, cutting the smoke on the banks of the Thames, the little room\n",
      "below where he had made men, old and bored and suspicious, listen to\n",
      "him; the more confident in his power to command their attention because\n",
      "he knew that they had read and discussed, agreed with and denounced, his\n",
      "sound contributions to colonial literature. The scene dissolved into a\n",
      "wave of homesickness that made him choke and spring to his feet. Then he\n",

      "When Judge Leslie learned that Hiram Otis's law library had been moved\n",

      "had mastered the laws governing the State of California, and the student\n",
      "was far better satisfied out there in the quiet and the fresh air of his\n",
      "veranda. When a point needed expounding, a horseback ride into Rosewater\n",
      "was not an unwelcome diversion. His will had triumphed in its first bout\n",
      "with memory, so subtly liberated by the written word, and before three\n",
      "days of close study had passed he had the sensation of having found a\n",
      "new and individual patch upon which squarely to plant his feet. The\n",
      "future seemed more definite, more assured; moreover, his avid brain, its\n",
      "energies too long in abeyance, settled upon the new and absorbing\n",
      "study--it was eight years since he had opened a law-book, although he\n",
      "had forgotten little he had read at that plastic time--like a swarm of\n",
      "locusts. He recalled that a clever woman had once said in his hearing\n",
      "that whenever she felt blasee she took up a new language, and at once\n",
      "felt young and eager again. The remark had passed him by at the time,\n",
      "but he recalled it as he devoured and stored away the statutes that in\n",
      "many ways differentiated California from the other States of the Union.\n",
      "The mere fact that his was not the order of brain that took kindly to\n",
      "monotonous application, but inspired him with the more ardent desire to\n",
      "conquer; the sense of being on any sort of a battle-field again gave a\n",
      "color to life. He realized that in six months more of inaction he should\n",
      "have fallen into a constant and morbid habit of self-analysis, and\n",
      "although his soul-sickness could not be healed in a moment, the sense of\n",
      "danger gave an added zest to the impersonal nature of his studies. He\n",
      "subscribed for all the San Francisco newspapers and for those of his own\n",
      "and the adjoining counties. He was not conscious of any mounting love\n",
      "for California, but here his lines were cast, and California was as good\n",
      "a stepping-stone as another. If her politics were hideous he had not\n",
      "made them, and his reviving faith in his star suggested that he may have\n",
      "been born to redeem them. With the polishing up of the rustier parts of\n",
      "his mind even his eyes grew brighter, he moved more quickly, he began to\n",
      "feel all intellect once more, propelled by a body that was daily gaining\n",
      "in red and vigorous blood. Judge Leslie was so delighted with his rapid\n",
      "progress and his exceptionally retentive and classifying memory that he\n",

      "him in England among all those old castles, and everything! I was sure\n",
      "he would have enough of California in a year and then I should visit you\n",
      "in England, and after a while you would marry Frances to a duke. But I\n",
      "see that was all nonsense. You don't care a bit about each other and are\n",
      "not in the least suited. I couldn't get up any sentiment for him myself;\n",

      "shameful if some San Francisco girl snapped him up--_and you know what\n",
      "they are_. He belongs by right to us, and I for one shall see to it that\n",
      "none of those man-eaters in San Francisco gets him. Did you notice how\n",
      "attentive he was to Dolly the other night? Well, he actually called the\n",
      "next day--she was out--and sent her flowers. Mrs. Haight saw him. She\n",
      "says he looked dreadfully disappointed as he rode off. I take that with\n",
      "a grain of salt, knowing Mrs. Haight; besides, he wouldn't break his\n",
      "heart if a girl was out for good. But the fact remains that he did call,\n",
      "and he hasn't called on another girl in Rosewater, much less sent her\n",
      "flowers. Serena Wheaton and one or two others were at my house\n",
      "yesterday. We are immensely excited over it. I am sure that if we\n",
      "managed them both properly there would be a wedding in the spring. It\n",
      "would be too delightful, for there hasn't been a bang-up wedding in\n",
      "Rosewater since mine. And think of Dolly's trousseau! Every stitch would\n",
      "come from New York. The San Francisco papers would be full of that\n",
      "wedding, and St. Peter would be green with envy. And she would make him\n",
      "such a good wife; such a beauty she is and such a dear good girl--just\n",
      "the kind that wouldn't mind a man being haughty and overbearing. You two\n",
      "would murder each other--but Dolly! The more I think of it the more\n",
      "enthusiastic I am. We formed a plot last night, but as in a way he\n",
      "belongs to you, I maintained that you should be consulted. But tell me\n",
      "first--what do you think of it?\"\n",
      "\"Of the match? I cannot imagine a better. What is your plan?\"\n",
      "\"Last night Mrs. Colton had a bridge party, and I went over just as they\n",
      "were finishing hissing at one another over a spoon that cost\n",
      "seventy-five cents. After some of them had gone, the rest began to talk\n",
      "about Dolly and Mr. Gwynne--I don't think the town has talked about\n",
      "anything else since your party--except those everlasting cards, of\n",
      "course. Well, the upshot was that I suggested we should revive the old\n",
      "weekly dancing club. Otherwise they might not meet again for months, now\n",
      "that Mr. Gwynne has settled down to his studies and hasn't been near\n",
      "Rosewater since Monday. They agreed, but of course no one would offer\n",
      "her house; they are all too mean, and mine is too small. But we can hire\n",
      "the old hall, and all the men will be glad to subscribe--a few of us can\n",
      "make up the deficit. Dolly always looks her best at night--she has the\n",
      "loveliest neck!--and she would be glad of an excuse to get more party\n",
      "dresses. Well--you see! You can always sleep at my house.\"\n",
      "\"What fun it will be to have a weekly dance! I am going out to Lumalitas\n",
      "this afternoon, and I will demand Mr. Gwynne's subscription.\"\n",
      "\"Isabel! You are a jewel! Mrs. Haight was nasty, but I told her she did\n",
      "not know you the least little bit, that you were no dog in the manger.\n",
      "But, dear Isabel, do you think you ought to go out there alone? I don't\n",
      "mind; you know that I never bother my head about other people's affairs,\n",
      "but Mrs. Haight is such a gossip, and she never did like you, and all\n",
      "small places are so gossipy. She has been telling everybody that Mr.\n",
      "Gwynne rides past her house quite late at night from duck-shooting, and\n",
      "of course she assumes that you shoot with him.\"\n",
      "\"I generally do. You may tell Mrs. Haight, with my compliments, to go to\n",
      "the devil! Still, dear Anabel, if you think it improper for me to call\n",
      "alone on a bachelor cousin, I will pick up somebody on my way out.\"\n",
      "\"Do, that's a dear. And I shall tell Mrs. Haight that old Mac always\n",
      "goes shooting with you. I am sure that he does. Good-bye. I'll see about\n",
      "the hall this afternoon.\"\n",
      "She drove off with lifted reins and a little flourish of her whip, and\n",
      "Isabel went into the house and telephoned first to Gwynne, who had\n",
      "installed a private wire between his house and hers, and then to Miss\n",
      "Boutts. At two o'clock she drew rein before a large brown shingle house\n",
      "on the highest point of Rosewater. Mr. Boutts had begun life in one of\n",
      "the little old peaked cottages down by the central square; later he had\n",
      "built an \"artistic\" cottage, and then a \"residence\"; symbolizing his\n",
      "increase not only by the more pretentious structures but by mounting the\n",
      "hill; the second cottage had been half-way up, the residence was on its\n",
      "apex, and could be seen by the envious traveller on boat and train.\n",
      "There was nothing left before him now but San Francisco or a balloon;\n",
      "heaven being out of the question.\n",
      "Miss Boutts awaited the buggy, in the tiny porch, and had obeyed\n",
      "Isabel's behest to look her prettiest. She wore a large red hat covered\n",
      "with feathers shading into pink, and a claret-colored frock that fitted\n",
      "her superb figure in a fashion that caused Isabel to draw her brows\n",
      "together and suggest a dust-coat.\n",
      "\"It is too sweet of you,\" said Miss Boutts, as she sprang into the\n",
      "buggy. \"I feel so flattered when you take any notice of insignificant\n",
      "little me. Do tell me where we are going and why you told me to look my\n",
      "prettiest!\"\n",
      "\"I must go out to Lumalitas to consult certain farmer's books in my\n",
      "cousin's library, and I thought it only fair to provide him with\n",
      "entertainment while I am busy. It seems the gossips do not approve of my\n",
      "going out there alone, and as I was obliged to go I did not think it\n",
      "worth while to make a martyr of Mr. Gwynne.\"\n",
      "Miss Boutts blushed and tossed her head. \"He called on me and sent me\n",
      "flowers,\" she said, in innocent triumph. \"I was so sorry to miss him.\n",
      "All the girls are fearfully jealous.\"\n",
      "\"Do you like him?\" asked Isabel, absently.\n",
      "\"Well--a little. He is new, and English, and different. There's not much\n",
      "to choose from here, and I don't know any of the swells in San\n",
      "Francisco. I can't say he is my ideal--that has always been an immensely\n",
      "tall man with big blue eyes and a tawny moustache; and Mr. Gwynne is\n",
      "just a sort of blond, no color in his hair at all, and I never did care\n",
      "much for gray eyes. He's tall enough, and the girls think him\n",
      "'distinguished,' but nobody could call him big. Besides, he doesn't know\n",
      "how to say sweet things one little bit. I went out on the veranda with\n",
      "him at your party, and it was a heavenly night, and all he asked me was\n",
      "if I wasn't afraid of catching cold, and then he wandered on about\n",
      "American girls exposing themselves foolishly and wearing too thin shoes\n",
      "and eating too many sweets. Fancy a man talking like that to a girl at\n",
      "night on a veranda! I never felt so flat.\"\n",
      "Isabel glanced curiously at the beautiful empty creature. Her black eyes\n",
      "looked like wells of sentiment, and her body a mould for a new race of\n",
      "men.\n",
      "\"Tell me,\" she exclaimed, impulsively. \"What do you expect a man to do\n",
      "under such circumstances--to--a--kiss you?\" She brought out the last\n",
      "with some effort, her old-fashioned training suddenly suggesting that\n",
      "she could better understand the downfall of the girl she had befriended\n",
      "in Paris than the vulgarities of the shallow.\n",
      "Miss Boutts laughed amusedly. \"Well, most men would have tried it. I\n",
      "never was one to make myself common, but once in a while--well! I\n",
      "haven't much opinion of a man who wouldn't snatch a kiss from a girl he\n",
      "admired to death, when he got a chance.\" She turned upon Isabel, curious\n",
      "in her turn. \"Of course you are lots older than I am--twenty-five or\n",
      "six, aren't you? And I am only just eighteen. But I always used to watch\n",
      "and wonder about you before you went away. I knew you were not the least\n",
      "bit like the other girls. I wonder what it is like to be different from\n",
      "other people. I always feel just like everybody else.\"\n",
      "\"So do I,\" said Isabel, encouragingly. \"It was only circumstances that\n",
      "made me appear different.\"\n",
      "\"But you know so much!\" sighed Miss Boutts. \"You speak a lot of\n",
      "languages, and you took all the honors at the High School--and then all\n",
      "those years in Europe! I wonder Mr. Gwynne will even look at any of\n",
      "us.\"\n",
      "\"Men like your sort much better,\" said Isabel, dryly. \"Do be nice to him\n",
      "to-day, and entertain him in your own style while I dig through those\n",
      "tiresome books. I sha'n't be long.\"\n",
      "Gwynne looked more than hospitable as he ran down the veranda steps to\n",
      "assist his guests out of the high buggy. When they had taken off their\n",
      "dust-cloaks and stood side by side he reflected that he had seldom seen\n",
      "two such handsome girls together. Isabel was far more simply dressed\n",
      "than Miss Boutts, but her little black jacket fitted perfectly, and\n",
      "there was a touch of pale blue at the neck, and in the lining of her\n",
      "large black hat, that deepened the blue of her eyes under their heavy\n",
      "black brows and lashes. Gwynne had never seen her look so girlish and\n",
      "ingenuous. She kept her profile from him and he saw only her smiling\n",
      "eyes and red half-opened mouth.\n",
      "\"I had to telephone to make sure you would be at home,\" she said. \"They\n",
      "say I mustn't come out here alone, and I didn't want Miss Boutts to be\n",
      "bored while I was at work. I'll leave you two here on the porch. That\n",
      "will be quite proper.\"\n",
      "As she nodded and went into the living-room she saw Gwynne turn to the\n",
      "lovely glowing girl left on his hands, with more intensity than she had\n",
      "seen him display since Mrs. Kaye took her black eyes and fine bust out\n",
      "of his life. As she made herself comfortable in his deepest chair she\n",
      "heard the girlish shallow voice launch out into a eulogy of the scenery.\n",
      "Gwynne responded with some enthusiasm; for a time there was a broken\n",
      "duet, and then the feminine voice settled down to a steady monologue.\n",
      "Miss Boutts knew that it was an American girl's business to be animated,\n",
      "entertaining, amusing, especially with Englishmen, who hated effort.\n",
      "Occasionally there was a masculine rumble, with a growing accent of\n",
      "desperation, and the indulgent little bursts of laughter diminished in\n",
      "frequence and spontaneity. Isabel lifted down volume after volume of the\n",
      "books on farming her uncle had collected, letting one fall, rattling\n",
      "leaves when leaves would rattle. An hour passed. She appropriated\n",
      "Gwynne's writing materials and took what appeared to be copious notes.\n",
      "The host suddenly excused himself and came within.\n",
      "\"Won't you have tea?\" he demanded. \"It is rather early, but after that\n",
      "drive--\"\n",
      "\"Much too early,\" said Isabel, absently. Her chin was on her hand, her\n",
      "eyes were on a spotted page. \"Mariana is sure to be asleep. Do go back\n",
      "to Dolly. She is one of those girls that can't bear to be left alone. I\n",
      "didn't bring her out here to be bored.\"\n",
      "\"Didn't you? What on earth do you want of all those notes? Are you going\n",
      "to write a treatise?\"\n",
      "\"Of course not. Do go back.\"\n",
      "Gwynne returned to the veranda. For more than another hour that sweet\n",
      "nasal monotonous voice trilled on. Then it began to flag. Then a silence\n",
      "ensued, broken at first by sporadic and staccato remarks, then becoming\n",
      "as dense as the silences of the night. Again Gwynne invaded his\n",
      "living-room.\n",
      "\"Isabel!\" he said, in a low tense tone.\n",
      "Isabel looked up dreamily and encountered a haggard face and a pair of\n",
      "blazing eyes. \"I'll never forgive you!\" he whispered.\n",
      "\"For what?\"\n",
      "\"For what! Do you want to drive me mad? Take her home!\"\n",
      "\"Do you mean to say that you have not been enjoying yourself?\"\n",
      "\"Enjoying myself! I have been on the rack.\"\n",
      "\"You are the rudest--most unsatisfactory--I thought I knew your taste.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, _please_!\"\n",
      "\"What do you mean?\"\n",
      "They confronted each other, Gwynne flushed and angry, Isabel coldly\n",
      "interrogative. Gwynne, who had been on the verge of an explosion, felt\n",
      "suddenly helpless. It was assuming a great deal to tell a woman that he\n",
      "saw through her plot to disenchant him with a rival. He could hear the\n",
      "descending whip of Isabel's scorn. Besides, it would mean a quarrel, and\n",
      "much as he resented her interference in his destinies, especially this\n",
      "last and most notable success, he had no desire to break up the even\n",
      "surface of their relation. So he merely shrugged his shoulders and said,\n",
      "with what calmness he could muster:\n",
      "\"Be kind enough to take her home. I will return the entire library if\n",
      "you need it.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, I have finished. I am sorry you have been bored.\" And she carefully\n",
      "gathered up her papers and went to the rescue of the weary Miss Boutts,\n",
      "while Gwynne ordered the buggy. During the drive towards the paternal\n",
      "roof Miss Boutts remarked casually that she didn't care about\n",
      "Englishmen, but otherwise had little to say.\n",
      "So ended the social regeneration of Rosewater.\n",
      "XVIII\n",
      "Gwynne awoke one morning with an irresistible desire for The Town in\n",
      "every fibre of his being. Barring London he would have liked three\n",
      "crowded days in New York, but as nothing better was available he felt\n",
      "that he was open to the attractions of San Francisco. He had not visited\n",
      "it since his departure on that brilliant Sunday after his arrival; he\n",
      "had promised to wait for Isabel, and his interest in it was\n",
      "intermittent. This morning he found his indifference culpable, inasmuch\n",
      "as he had had three letters from his mother imploring him to increase\n",
      "her income, and Mr. Colton had not only strongly advised him to tear\n",
      "down the block of old structures south of Market Street, and put up a\n",
      "great office building, but had offered to raise the money--selling half\n",
      "the land and mortgaging the rest. And if Gwynne had not revisited San\n",
      "Francisco he had a very accurate idea of its present conditions. It was\n",
      "uncommonly rich, and its citizens, always sanguine of its future, had\n",
      "been seized with a very fever of faith; they were selling out their\n",
      "interests everywhere else and buying and building, tearing down and\n",
      "rebuilding, until San Francisco threatened to lose its oddly patched and\n",
      "wholly individual appearance and become the Western city of\n",
      "sky-scrapers.\n",
      "As Gwynne dressed he recalled his first impression of the city as he\n",
      "crossed the bay: its singularly desolate appearance, in spite of what\n",
      "at first looked to be a compact mass of buildings covering some thirty\n",
      "thousand acres on hill and plain, and later as if a comet had rained\n",
      "down pickings from every architectural quarter of the universe. He had\n",
      "walked once to the back of the boat and looked at the line of little\n",
      "towns and cities lying at the base of the eastern hills. They did\n",
      "nothing to dispel the impression of loneliness. Whatever their\n",
      "individual names they were mere annexes of the great-little city\n",
      "opposite. When he returned to the forward deck the dust was blowing its\n",
      "brown volumes through every street that converged to the water-front.\n",
      "Those dust wracks, broken and narrowed by the buildings, lifted from the\n",
      "outlying sand-dunes, and following a law that had driven them eastward\n",
      "since California had risen from the deeps, had a curiously baffled,\n",
      "stolidly persistent expression, as if the old sand-dunes knew their\n",
      "rights and were determined to assert themselves so long as man left a\n",
      "yard of them free.\n",
      "Gwynne, in his solitary moments, when even his law-books were closed,\n",
      "had recalled the stories of San Francisco, past and present, told him by\n",
      "Isabel, and they had given rise to many whimsies. California, he still\n",
      "all but disliked, but he wondered at the haunting memory of the city he\n",
      "had seen so briefly, and the odd almost pathetic appeal it had made to\n",
      "his sympathies. He had concluded that it was the pioneer taint in his\n",
      "English blood, and had blinked in sudden wonder before the fact of his\n",
      "close kinship, not only to that old romantic Spanish element, but to the\n",
      "brilliant adventurous lawless race of men that had made the city great\n",
      "and famous, then passed on into the kingdom of darkness leaving their\n",
      "moral rottenness in its foundations, and, pulsing above, all their old\n",
      "brave indomitable and progressive spirit. Although he had found it no\n",
      "rival to his studies and his ranch, still he had given it more thought\n",
      "than he was aware, and not only to its picturesque psychology, but as\n",
      "the seat of a possible business adventure. To raise a large sum of money\n",
      "on the San Francisco real estate--the common property of his mother and\n",
      "himself--and erect a great office building of steel and reinforced\n",
      "concrete, would add enormously to his own and his mother's incomes, but\n",
      "on the other hand it would stand in the midst of acres of wooden\n",
      "buildings and shanties, and the risk of a great fire--whose momentum\n",
      "would sweep through any fireproof building--was one forgotten neither by\n",
      "the insurance agents nor the chief of the fire department, who was said\n",
      "to keep thousands of tons of dynamite in the city with which to\n",
      "segregate the always expected conflagration. It was possible that no\n",
      "insurance company would take the risk on an expensive building in such a\n",
      "quarter. On the other hand it was as certain as the present wealth of\n",
      "the city, that such a building would have hundreds of companions in the\n",
      "next ten years, and the undesirable, immoral, and generally drunken\n",
      "element, so largely responsible for the continual fires of the district,\n",
      "would be gradually pressed to the outskirts of the city. He felt\n",
      "inclined to take the risk, even a sense of exhilaration in it, as if\n",
      "indeed the dead and gone Otises had invaded his soul and demanded one\n",
      "more bout on earth.\n",
      "There was another matter that claimed his thoughts when the law was at\n",
      "rest. He was suspicious and resentful of Isabel's desire to manage him;\n",
      "and that she had succeeded more than once, through her superior feminine\n",
      "subtlety, made him aware that two strong natures were slowly bracing\n",
      "themselves against each other, and that on some future battle-ground\n",
      "there might be a heavy and final encounter. This morning, as he ordered\n",
      "his portmanteau to be packed and placed in the buggy, his impulse was to\n",
      "take the tram, and cavalierly announce, upon their next meeting, that he\n",
      "had \"been to town.\" After he had had his coffee, however, he decided not\n",
      "to be an ass, and unpardonably rude as well. She had talked of this\n",
      "visit every time they had met, although one thing and another had\n",
      "detained her, and he could hardly explain to her an impetuous and\n",
      "solitary flight. He colored as he invoked her assumption that he feared\n",
      "and was running away from her, asserting his independence like any\n",
      "school-boy. Besides there was the launch. The idea of three hours on the\n",
      "water instead of one and a half on a slow and dirty train so exhilarated\n",
      "him that he forgot his self-communings and ordered the buggy at once. It\n",
      "was but half-past five. They would catch the tide; nor did the train\n",
      "leave until half-past eight. He presented Imura Kisaburo Hinamoto with a\n",
      "box of cigarettes, gave him the run of the library, and drove off\n",
      "whistling.\n",
      "He found Isabel among the chickens. She had just opened the doors of all\n",
      "the little colony houses, and the hills were white with excited\n",
      "scratching Leghorns. She wore overalls and high boots, and the night\n",
      "braid of her hair was twisted several times round her throat. Gwynne\n",
      "smiled as he recalled the heroines of poesy that had fed so many doves\n",
      "and garden birds. No heroine could look picturesque in bloomers, and\n",
      "feeding chickens, but as Isabel came towards him waving her hand\n",
      "hospitably, her white clear-cut face resting on its black _goita_ of\n",
      "hair might have suggested Stuck's Suende, in the Neue Pinakothek of\n",
      "Munich, had there been an evil glint in her light cool blue eyes. The\n",
      "fleeting query crossed his mind as to what she might have been if born\n",
      "in one of the generations before the pioneers of her sex had opened so\n",
      "many gates for the irruption of overburdened femininity. But he merely\n",
      "remarked:\n",
      "\"I am suddenly inspired With a desire to see San Francisco. Are you too\n",
      "busy? Are we too late for the tide?\"\n",
      "\"Just in time,\" said Isabel, promptly; \"and I shall be ready as soon as\n",
      "the launch is. Do you know that it is Saturday? You could not have\n",
      "chosen a better day.\"\n",
      "*       *       *       *       *\n",
      "As they pushed off, all the marsh and its creek was covered with a low\n",
      "white mist that gave it the appearance of a great lake, a ghost lake\n",
      "through which the little steamer just leaving Rosewater two miles above\n",
      "coiled its way like a monstrous white bird feeling uneasily for a\n",
      "foothold. Overhead the sky was covered with the pink fleece of dawn. The\n",
      "mass of mountains in Marin County looked black and formless, but above\n",
      "them rose the granite crest of Tamalpais, like an angular lifted\n",
      "shoulder.\n",
      "\"That mountain has marched north five feet in the last forty years,\"\n",
      "said Isabel, as she carefully steered through the mist. \"Either that, or\n",
      "the earthquake of 1868 moved her off her base.\"\n",
      "\"For heaven's sake don't tell me any more weird tales about this\n",
      "country; it gives me the horrors often enough as it is. This morning the\n",
      "hills and mountain on the other side of the valley looked like\n",
      "antediluvian monsters just ready to turn over.\"\n",
      "\"Well, they have turned over a few times, and may again. One reason we\n",
      "all love California is because we never know what she will do next, and\n",
      "because she is still primeval under this thin coat of civilization that\n",
      "is too tight for her. I admire England, but I could not live in it. It\n",
      "is too peaceful, too done. It is impossible to imagine any further\n",
      "change, for civilization can go no further. But out here--the whole\n",
      "country may stand on its head any day; and we may yet have cities as\n",
      "great as Babylon and Nineveh.\"\n",
      "\"Well, we'll not be here to see. This fog is just high enough to filter\n",
      "into one's very marrow--even your picturesque pioneer days are over; I\n",
      "will confess they might have made me feel that life on the edge of the\n",
      "world was worth while. I should have liked to lay the foundations of a\n",
      "great isolated city like San Francisco; but I don't see any sign of\n",
      "another big city. Los Angeles is a little Chicago and may live to be a\n",
      "big one, but nothing would induce me to live in the south. However, no\n",
      "man is ever conscious of the fact that he is in at the birth of a great\n",
      "city; our pioneer forefathers were just a parcel of adventurers crazed\n",
      "with the lust of gold, and with no sense of any future beyond the\n",
      "present.\"\n",
      "Isabel leaned forward eagerly. \"You have been thinking about San\n",
      "Francisco!\" she exclaimed, triumphantly. \"The old Otis blood is\n",
      "beginning to wake up! Hooray!\"\n",
      "Gwynne laughed outright, and for the first time without resentment; he\n",
      "was tired of having California \"rammed down his throat.\" Isabel's eyes\n",
      "were dancing with so purely youthful and feminine a triumph that he\n",
      "could not but feel indulgent.\n",
      "\"I am growing reconciled to my lot. Here I am and here I remain.\"\n",
      "\"Yes, you are much happier,\" said Isabel, softly. She half closed her\n",
      "eyes and looked a trifle older. \"It worried me dreadfully at first to\n",
      "know that you were unhappy, and that it was my fault.\"\n",
      "\"Unhappy!\" exclaimed Gwynne, reddening haughtily. \"I have not been\n",
      "mooning about like a homesick ass--\"\n",
      "\"Oh, your outside was as tranquil as your pride demanded--and it was\n",
      "splendid! But I couldn't help knowing--feeling. A thousand little things\n",
      "appeal so directly to a woman's intuitions.\"\n",
      "\"Indeed! I am delighted to learn that you possess the common intuitions\n",
      "of a woman.\"\n",
      "\"Am I unwomanly? Masculine?\" asked Isabel, anxiously.\n",
      "\"Not in the ordinary sense; but you are much too strong. No woman should\n",
      "be as strong--as, well--as psychically independent as you are. It is as\n",
      "flagrant a usurpation of prerogative as a pretty complexion on a man.\"\n",
      "\"I only say one prayer: 'Give me strength. Give me strength.'\"\n",
      "\"For what, in heaven's name? What use have you for so much strength? You\n",
      "have forsworn matrimony. You disclaim the intention of going forth and\n",
      "entering the great battle of the intellects--having, as you say, no\n",
      "talents. You have isolated yourself from love, so you need no uncommon\n",
      "supply of strength to meet suffering. You will always have money enough,\n",
      "and you appear to have been born with the gift of making it. Even if you\n",
      "elect to be the leader of fashion in San Francisco, your equipment need\n",
      "not be of unadulterated steel. But I cannot fancy why you entertain any\n",
      "such ambition.\"\n",
      "\"That is the least of my ambition--although I intend to become the most\n",
      "notable woman in San Francisco, not only because I must gratify a\n",
      "healthy natural ambition in some way, and because I want my life to have\n",
      "a sufficiency of incident in it, but because it is a part of my general\n",
      "scheme.\"\n",
      "\"What is this precious scheme?\"\n",
      "\"You would not understand if I should tell you. Men have no time for\n",
      "subjectivities--except poets, psychological fictionists, and the like,\n",
      "who do not seem to me men at all. Now, one reason I have liked you from\n",
      "the first, in spite of many things that made my American blood boil, is\n",
      "that you are a man, a real masculine arrogant dense man, with no\n",
      "feminine morbid tendency to analyze your ego, in spite of your Celtic\n",
      "blood. I met too many of that sort in Europe.\"\n",
      "Gwynne, with his elbows on his knees, regarded the bottom of the boat\n",
      "and colored guiltily, while congratulating himself that for all her\n",
      "insight and cleverness she had barely penetrated his outer envelope. She\n",
      "had thought him merely homesick, when his ego had been tottering, his\n",
      "soul racked with doubt and terror; when he had spent long hours in\n",
      "self-analysis; until the law had come to his rescue and reinvigorated\n",
      "his brain. At the same time a wave of sadness swept over him. How little\n",
      "human beings knew one another, no matter how intimate. As he raised his\n",
      "eyes he seemed to see Isabel across a chasm as vast as the Atlantic; and\n",
      "he was reminded that he knew her as little as she him. She had confessed\n",
      "to the throes of what she believed to have been a great passion, but\n",
      "when he had rehearsed the story away from the influence of her curious\n",
      "cold magnetism and the sinister setting of its recital, he had\n",
      "recognized it for what it was, the first violent embrace of an ardent\n",
      "unshackled imagination with positive experience, in which the ego had\n",
      "played an insignificant part. Her immediate recovery upon beholding the\n",
      "disintegrating clay, without one regret for the vanished soul, or even\n",
      "for the magnetic warmth of the living shell, suggested to his groping\n",
      "masculine intelligence, totally unaccustomed to analysis of woman, that\n",
      "her attack had been little more personal than if the man had infected\n",
      "her with the microbe of influenza. Surely a woman that had loved a man\n",
      "well enough to kiss him must have been stabbed with pity for the ardent\n",
      "vigorous life thrust out into the dark. Then he felt a quick resentment\n",
      "that anything so stainlessly statuesque as this girl--for all her trim\n",
      "tailoring and large black hat--should have been even superficially\n",
      "possessed by any man.\n",
      "\"Did that Johnny ever kiss you?\" he asked, abruptly.\n",
      "\"Of course,\" replied Isabel. \"Did I not have to, being engaged to him?\n",
      "Not that there was much chance, for I never saw him alone between four\n",
      "walls. Perhaps that was one reason that side of love seemed to me much\n",
      "overrated. I was happiest when sitting alone in a sort of trance and\n",
      "thinking about him.\"\n",
      "\"Humph!\" said Gwynne.\n",
      "The mist was gone. The east was a vast alcove of gold in which the hills\n",
      "were set like hard dark jewels. The creek was narrowing. On either side,\n",
      "and far on all sides, stretched the marsh. The guileless duck disported\n",
      "himself on the ponds, but Gwynne, for once, was insensible to its\n",
      "subversive charms, felt no regret that he had forgotten his gun. He came\n",
      "and sat closer to Isabel, wondering if she felt as young as he did in\n",
      "the wonderful freshness and beauty of the dawn. She certainly looked\n",
      "very young and fresh and girlish, not in the least fateful, as when she\n",
      "turned her profile against a hard background and forgot his presence.\n",
      "\"I think I could quite understand anything you cared to tell me,\" he\n",
      "said, smiling into her eyes. \"Please give me your reasons for\n",
      "cultivating the character of a Toledo blade. Is it your intention\n",
      "to marshal all the clans of all the advanced women and lead them\n",
      "against the more occupied and disunited sex? I am told that it is\n",
      "a standing grievance in Rosewater that you will not join that\n",
      "Literary--Political--Improvement--and all the rest of it Club. I should\n",
      "think with your ambitions and--well--masterful disposition, you would\n",
      "assume its leadership as a sort of preliminary course.\"\n",
      "\"I intend to be a whole club in myself.\"\n",
      "\"Appalling! But what _do_ you mean by that cryptic assertion? I told you\n",
      "that I could understand anything you chose to explain, but, as they say\n",
      "out here, I am not good at guessing.\"\n",
      "\"I am working out a theory of my own. It has been demonstrated that\n",
      "labor, capital, all the known forces, are far stronger when concentrated\n",
      "and organized. I believe in concentrating all the faculties about a will\n",
      "strong enough not only to conquer life but all the inherited weaknesses\n",
      "that beset one daily within. That is a minor matter, however. I believe\n",
      "that our higher faculties were given to us for no purpose but to create\n",
      "within ourselves an individual strength that will add to the sum of\n",
      "strength in the world. It is not necessary to proclaim this strength\n",
      "from the house-tops, nor to search for windmills--a positive enemy it\n",
      "would leap at automatically--nor even to seek to improve the world by\n",
      "all the tried and generally futile devices. It is enough to be. I alone\n",
      "may not add greatly to this subjective strength of the world; but think\n",
      "what life would be did each individual succeed in making himself but one\n",
      "degree less strong than God himself! It may be my destiny to make\n",
      "propaganda without noise; but if not, the achievement of absolute\n",
      "strength in myself will move the world forward to its millennium\n",
      "one-millionth part of a degree at least. For that will be the real\n",
      "millennium--when there shall be no despicable weakness in the world, no\n",
      "moral rottenness, when each individual shall rely upon himself alone,\n",
      "independent of the environment from which the majority to-day draw\n",
      "everything good and bad, their happiness or misery. Nothing will ever\n",
      "purge human nature but the triumph of the higher faculties, a triumph\n",
      "accomplished by an unswervingly cultivated and jealously maintained\n",
      "strength.\"\n",
      "\"I don't deny that your millennium has its points, but would that not be\n",
      "rather a hard world? What of love, the interdependence of the sexes, and\n",
      "all the other human relations?\"\n",
      "\"It is love and interdependence that cause all the misery of the world;\n",
      "they would be the very first things I should relegate among the minor\n",
      "influences, did I wield the sceptre for an hour. To women, at least, all\n",
      "unhappiness comes from the superstition that love--any sort--is all. Of\n",
      "course there would be marriage, but of deliberate choice, and after a\n",
      "long and purely platonic friendship, in which all the horrid little\n",
      "failings that do most to dissever could be recognized and weighed. Free\n",
      "love and experimental matrimony are mere excuses for the sort of\n",
      "sensuality that is shallow and inconstant.\"\n",
      "\"Ah! Then you would permit love to your married pair after they had\n",
      "probed each other's minds and mannerisms for a year or two? That is a\n",
      "concession I hardly expected.\"\n",
      "Isabel shrugged her shoulders. \"I am neither an idiot nor blind. Heaven\n",
      "knows I have seen enough of reckless passion and its consequences. The\n",
      "equipment of the mortal proves him to be the slave of the race, but at\n",
      "least he need not remain the blind and ridiculous slave he is at\n",
      "present. If I had married that man no doubt I should have loved him more\n",
      "frantically than ever for a time. But that would have passed, left me\n",
      "resentful of bondage, of the surrender of self. There, above all, is the\n",
      "reason I shall never marry. Impersonally, I believe in marriage, or\n",
      "rather accept it, but I purpose to stand apart as a complete individual,\n",
      "and subtly to teach others to drag strength out of the great body of\n",
      "force in which we move, until they realize that in time mankind may feed\n",
      "those creative fires, becoming, who knows, stronger than the great first\n",
      "cause itself.\"\n",
      "\"And I have been called an egoist,\" murmured Gwynne. \"I feel a\n",
      "mere--well--Leghorn--beside this sublime determination to sit upon the\n",
      "throne of God and administer to both kingdoms. All the same, my fair\n",
      "cousin, I believe that it takes a man and a woman to complete the ego. I\n",
      "incline to the picturesque belief that they were originally united, and\n",
      "halved in some--well, say when Earth and its atmosphere became two\n",
      "distinct parts. No doubt it was a judgment for having accomplished too\n",
      "much evil in that formidable combination. Who knows but that may be the\n",
      "secret of the fall of man; the uneven progress of human nature may be\n",
      "towards the resumption of that state, only to be attained when we have\n",
      "conquered the worst in ourselves and become pure spirit.\"\n",
      "\"That fits my own theory, for I believe that the two parts of what\n",
      "should have been a perfect whole were cut in two for their sins, and\n",
      "that reunion will come only when each has absolutely mastered the human\n",
      "evil in him and freed the spiritual, but this he can only accomplish\n",
      "alone--\"\n",
      "\"Don't quote Tolstoi to me! He waited until he was old and cold to hurl\n",
      "anathema against the human passions. Theories upon love by a man long\n",
      "past his prime are as valueless as those of a girl.\"\n",
      "\"It was a theory I had no intention of advancing. I think for myself and\n",
      "pay no more attention to the excessive virtue bred by the years than to\n",
      "that equally illogical repentance or awakening of a woman's moral nature\n",
      "when the man has ceased to charm or has disappeared. That is a mere\n",
      "process, and no augury of future behavior. But you are always at your\n",
      "best when you go off at half-cock like that! What I meant was that woman\n",
      "has degenerated, not through passion but through ages of the exercise of\n",
      "her pettier and meaner qualities. In some, these qualities lead to\n",
      "malignancy, in the majority, no doubt, to frivolity--still worse, to my\n",
      "puritanical inheritance--and they are utterly commonplace of outlook.\n",
      "Matrimony keeps these qualities in constant exercise, because the ego\n",
      "loses its independent life, its habit of meditation, and is pin-pricked\n",
      "twenty times a day. It is by these qualities that woman chains man to\n",
      "the earth, not by her human passions. I am quite willing to concede that\n",
      "passion is magnificent.\"\n",
      "Gwynne ground his teeth. He had never encountered anything so\n",
      "incongruous as this beautiful vital superbly fashioned girl talking of\n",
      "passion in precisely the same tone as she would have talked of chickens.\n",
      "He felt the primitive man's impulse to beat her black and blue and then\n",
      "make her his creature. As Isabel turned her eyes she was astonished at\n",
      "what she saw in his. Gwynne's eyes were blazing. There was a dark color\n",
      "in his face, and even his mouth, somewhat heavy, and generally set, was\n",
      "half open. She fancied that so he looked when on a platform facing the\n",
      "enemy, and thoroughly awake.\n",
      "\"What are you angry about?\" she asked, calmly. \"That I devote myself to\n",
      "my sex instead of to yours? They need me more than any leader they have\n",
      "evolved so far. There are millions of women of your sort. I want nothing\n",
      "that your sex has left to offer. I will find a happiness unimaginable to\n",
      "you, in living absolutely within myself and independent of all that\n",
      "life, so far, has to give.\"\n",
      "Then Gwynne exploded, and forgot himself. He flung himself forward, and\n",
      "catching her upper arms in the grip of a vise shook her until her teeth\n",
      "clacked together. \"Damn you! Damn you!\" he stammered. \"What you want is\n",
      "to be the squaw of one of your own Indians!\"\n",
      "\"Let me go!\" gasped Isabel, furious, and in sharp physical pain. \"Do you\n",
      "want to turn the boat over? Have you gone mad? I'll _kick_ you!\"\n",
      "\"Good!\" said Gwynne, releasing her, and sitting back. \"That is the only\n",
      "feminine speech you have made since I have known you. I make no apology.\n",
      "You need never speak to me again. Set me ashore over there. I can take\n",
      "the train when it comes along.\"\n",
      "\"You pinched me! You hurt me!\" cried, Isabel in wrath and dismay. \"I\n",
      "hate you!\"\n",
      "\"And your sentiments are cordially returned. Will you put me on shore?\"\n",
      "\"I don't care what you do. You hurt me! You hurt me!\" And Isabel dropped\n",
      "her head into her arms and burst into a wild tempest of tears, like a\n",
      "child that has had its first whipping.\n",
      "Gwynne laughed aloud. \"We are running into a mud bank,\" he said, \"and\n",
      "the tide is going out.\"\n",
      "Isabel made a wild clutch at the tiller ropes, and brought the boat back\n",
      "into the channel. But she could scarcely see, and Gwynne with a\n",
      "contrition he had no intention of displaying offered to control the\n",
      "launch. She vouchsafed him no reply, and as she did not steer for the\n",
      "land, he retired to the extreme end of the boat and studied the scenery.\n",
      "He was determined not to go through even the form of an apology, but he\n",
      "was equally determined upon a reconciliation. In his first attempt to\n",
      "match his wits with a woman's his face became so stony and intense that\n",
      "Isabel recovered in a bound the serenity she had been struggling for,\n",
      "and laughed with a gayety that would have deceived any man.\n",
      "\"We are a couple of naughty children,\" she said, sweetly. \"Or maybe\n",
      "people are not quite civilized so early in the morning. You may smoke,\n",
      "if you like, and then I shouldn't mind if you came here and let me teach\n",
      "you to run this launch--it is probably more old-fashioned than any you\n",
      "have undertaken. But as we no doubt shall make many journeys it is only\n",
      "fair that you should do half the work.\"\n",
      "XIX\n",
      "When they docked at the foot of Russian Hill, Isabel suggested that\n",
      "Gwynne should leave his portmanteau with Mr. Clatt, the wharfinger that\n",
      "lived at the edge of the sea-wall and looked after such launches and\n",
      "yachts as came his way.\n",
      "\"I want you to stay with me if Lyster and Paula will come too,\" she\n",
      "said, hospitably. \"They like that sort of thing when they happen to have\n",
      "a nurse. If they cannot come you will have to go to one of the hotels.\n",
      "In either case you can send here for your suit-case. You had better take\n",
      "the Jones Street car--\"\n",
      "\"The track is bust,\" said Mr. Clatt, who was a laconic person.\n",
      "\"Walk along the docks to Polk Street and then south until you find a\n",
      "car--I think it turns in at Pacific Avenue. The conductor will tell you\n",
      "where to transfer--\"\n",
      "\"Are there no cabs?\"\n",
      "\"There are hacks and coupes at the livery-stables, if you care to expend\n",
      "ten or fifteen dollars for being less comfortable than in the cars.\n",
      "Remember our hills are little off the perpendicular.\"\n",
      "She did not see fit to inform him that his business would not take him\n",
      "into the hilly district, and watched him wend his way along the noisy,\n",
      "dirty, evil-smelling docks with some satisfaction. Then she climbed the\n",
      "steep hill to her house, over the crest. There were many cottages on\n",
      "this side of Russian Hill and one or two fine residences, but beyond one\n",
      "cable-car line little or nothing had been done to make life easy for the\n",
      "inhabitants. It was a bit of pioneer San Francisco. One day, no doubt,\n",
      "there would be a boulevard at its foot, the rough inhospitable cliff\n",
      "would be terraced, and set with the country-like villas of people that\n",
      "appreciated the beauties of the bay and Tamalpais, but at present a\n",
      "carriage could not mount it, and it made no appeal to the luxurious.\n",
      "An elderly couple lived in the \"Belmont House\" and did all that was\n",
      "necessary in the present stage of Isabel's fortunes. She found the woman\n",
      "house-cleaning and the old man weeding among the abundant crysanthemums\n",
      "and asters in the half acre which still surrounded the old mansion. She\n",
      "gave her orders and started for the home of her sister. A belated\n",
      "trade-wind was screaming through the city driving the dust before it.\n",
      "Isabel looked down at the towers and the domes, the steeples and walls\n",
      "of the great modern buildings, the low city built in the days when San\n",
      "Franciscans still feared earthquakes, all looming through the torn brown\n",
      "veil like the mirage of a city infinitely distant. But San Francisco was\n",
      "rarely more beautiful than in a dust-storm, which recombined her\n",
      "outlines and the patchwork of her crowded generations into something\n",
      "like harmony. She looked dreaming, proud, detached, an houri veiled to\n",
      "allure, to inspire a new race of poets. Gwynne holding his hat on his\n",
      "head with both hands, in the valley, cursed the climate, but Isabel\n",
      "picking her way down the crazy old staircase, although in anything but a\n",
      "poetical mood, paused a moment with that sudden outrush and uplift that\n",
      "was the only passion she had ever known. Such moments were not frequent\n",
      "and brought with them a sense of impersonality, as if she were but the\n",
      "vehicle of aspiring passionate souls long gone from their own clay, that\n",
      "rushed back through familiar conduits like volcanic fires, eager for the\n",
      "arch of the visible world.\n",
      "But ancestral rights had short shrift this morning. Isabel's spirit was\n",
      "a very caldron. She not only still raged at the fact that for a few\n",
      "seconds she had been as helpless in the grip of mere brute strength as\n",
      "any peasant woman, but she was keenly disappointed that Gwynne had not\n",
      "understood her. That he might have understood her too well, his whole\n",
      "sex precipitating itself upon the new enemy, she would not admit for a\n",
      "moment; women, with a sort of dishonest mental confusion, invariably\n",
      "substituting the word misunderstood for failure to accept their own\n",
      "point of view. Above all, was she furious with herself. Instead of\n",
      "annihilating him with the dignity of which she possessed an uncommon\n",
      "share, she had been surprised into behaving as if she were the crudest\n",
      "of mere human creatures.\n",
      "Moreover, her arms still pained, and she knew that they were black and\n",
      "blue.\n",
      "At the foot of the bluff she ran into a basement doorway to pin on her\n",
      "veil more securely, and dismissed psychology as incompatible with\n",
      "trade-winds and dust. A block or two farther on she took a cable car\n",
      "which slipped rapidly down the western slope, across the narrow valley,\n",
      "then up another and steeper hill, all blooming with flowers in the\n",
      "narrow gardens. She alighted at a corner half-way to the summit, and\n",
      "walked back to one of those curious San Francisco \"Flat Houses\" with\n",
      "three doors in a row. It was perched high above the sidewalk, for the\n",

      "\"Those two weeks cost a good deal,\" said Paula, softly.\n",
      "Isabel colored but controlled her anger as she had many times before. \"I\n",
      "was under the impression that the check I gave you when I left--\"\n",
      "\"Oh yes, but then you really don't know much about the cost of things,\n",
      "in spite of the fact that you run a farm. We always had an extra man for\n",
      "you--\"\n",
      "\"I could well have dispensed with the dissipated fad-ridden specimens\n",
      "you produced for my entertainment. I did not meet a sober man during the\n",
      "entire fortnight. What is the amount of your indebtedness? I will pay\n",
      "half, but no more.\"\n",
      "She knew that it would be wiser to demand the bills and herself pay\n",
      "something on account to the desperate creditors, but she revolted from\n",
      "playing the mentor to that extent. When Paula, after a frowning bout\n",
      "with a pencil and a sheet of paper, announced the sum that would tide\n",
      "them over, Isabel was quite aware that she was facing the entire amount.\n",
      "However, she wrote a check, merely extracting a facile promise that it\n",
      "should be devoted to its legitimate purpose, and not to champagne or\n",
      "frills.\n",
      "\"I will also send you down one or two tailor suits I have little use\n",
      "for,\" she added. \"Things are so cheap in Europe that I was often\n",
      "betrayed into buying more than I wanted. They can easily be altered.\"\n",
      "\"Thanks!\" said Paula. \"I am not the style for tailor-made things, but\n",
      "goodness knows I am glad enough to get anything.\"\n",
      "Isabel glanced doubtfully at the slippers. \"I have so many boots. They\n",
      "are rather an extravagance with me--but I am afraid my foot is longer\n",
      "than yours.\"\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Paula, complacently, as she threaded a darning-needle. \"My\n",
      "foot is quite _fearfully_ small.\"\n",
      "Isabel, who knew her foot to be far more slender and elegant than the\n",
      "plebeian member that never dared expose itself beyond the instep, nearly\n",
      "overflowed with feminine wrath; but she swallowed it, and remarked in a\n",
      "moment:\n",
      "\"I had quite forgotten why I tried to telephone. Mr. Gwynne came down\n",
      "with me and I should like to show him about a bit. Of course I cannot do\n",
      "it alone; what is more, I want him to stay in my house. Nothing could\n",
      "exceed his hospitality to me in England, and I should hate the idea of\n",
      "sending him to a hotel when I have a house with eight bedrooms. Couldn't\n",
      "you and Lyster come up and stay for a couple of days? And if Lyster will\n",
      "show Mr. Gwynne the town, as indeed he has suggested more than once, it\n",
      "must be understood that the expense is mine.\"\n",
      "\"Lyster would never permit it,\" said Paula, grandly. \"You know what he\n",
      "is--he even lends more than he borrows; that is one reason why we are\n",
      "always so hard up. He is simply dying to show Mr. Gwynne about. And that\n",
      "means that he'll spend a month's salary before he gets it.\"\n",
      "\"Then I will pay the month's bills. You must manage it as I wish or I\n",
      "return to-day.\"\n",
      "Isabel knew that Stone, if not generous in the higher sense, was\n",
      "delighted to play the extravagant host, and never failed to assume the\n",
      "role when he had money or credit. And if he was the freest and most\n",
      "debonair of borrowers at least he repaid when unusually prosperous; and\n",
      "he prided himself upon never having borrowed from a woman. Once when\n",
      "Isabel, who could not help liking him, had offered to pay his debts, he\n",
      "had promptly ascended from the depths of depression in which she had\n",
      "discovered him before his easel, and replied, gayly:\n",
      "\"Not yet! The sort of man that borrows money from a woman is the sort of\n",
      "man that has no intention of paying it back. I am not that sort.\"\n",
      "With a wife who was or had been an adoring slave, it was little wonder\n",
      "that Stone's original selfishness had become abnormally enhanced, and\n",
      "Isabel took into account the feminine silliness of which he had been a\n",
      "victim since birth. His mother, well-born, southern, indolent, had\n",
      "indulged him in every whim during his boyhood; then when the familiar\n",
      "San Francisco crash came, he had turned to actual work with an exceeding\n",
      "ill grace. The easy ladies of the lower slopes, with whom he had tastes\n",
      "more than Bohemian in common, had admired him extravagantly, and when he\n",
      "finally met a girl that suited his tastes as exactly, and was\n",
      "respectable to boot, he became a devoted if somewhat erratic husband. He\n",
      "was now thirty-eight and all hope of graduation from perpetual\n",
      "irresponsible boyhood had been destroyed long since by a woman abjectly\n",
      "in love with him and too shrewd to antagonize him. With a strong brain\n",
      "and character a wife might have kept him on the upward artistic path and\n",
      "converted him to a measure of domesticity. But Paula had neither, was,\n",
      "moreover, quite satisfied with her mental equipment and blooming little\n",
      "person; so much so indeed that of late she was beginning to think\n",
      "herself thrown away, a matrimonial offering; to weary of being the mere\n",
      "annex of her brilliant husband. She was very clever in her fashion,\n",
      "however, and Stone still thought her his willing slave, although curtain\n",
      "lectures were less infrequent than of yore. And she had learned to\n",
      "manage him in many ways he would have thought it a waste of time to\n",
      "suspect.\n",
      "\"It will be all right,\" she said to Isabel. \"He always thinks I have\n",
      "more money than I have, for he never could do arithmetic at school and\n",
      "still believes that two and two make five. I shall be delighted to get\n",
      "out of this skyscraper for a few days.\" And then she asked,\n",
      "insinuatingly, if she could not take the children.\n",
      "But upon this point Isabel was obdurate, knowing that if Paula once\n",
      "planted her entire family in the Belmont House the police could not\n",
      "uproot them. Moreover, although she liked children, she detested\n",
      "Paula's. They were pert and spoiled, untidy and noisy, although handsome\n",
      "and highly bred of feature. She never saw them that she did not fall\n",
      "into a sort of panic at the thought that similar little creatures full\n",
      "of present and potential nuisance might have been her own, and then felt\n",
      "extraordinarily light of spirit in the reflection that she had escaped a\n",
      "lot she had as yet seen no reason to envy.\n",
      "\"Have you no nurse?\" she asked.\n",
      "\"Oh yes. She has been threatening to leave--has been _fearfully_\n",
      "disagreeable--but I suppose she will stay, now that I can pay her.\" Mrs.\n",
      "Paula wisely gave up the point and invited her visitor to remain for\n",
      "luncheon. But Isabel rose hastily.\n",
      "\"I must go home and see that everything is in order--the beds aired, and\n",
      "lunch prepared for Mr. Gwynne in case he should turn up. Then you will\n",
      "come about four? And we will dine out somewhere?\"\n",
      "\"I'll pack all the decent things I possess and send them up right away.\n",
      "Fortunately the dress Lyster gave me last month is quite fresh, so I\n",
      "shall not feel too small beside your magnificence, and I am sure that\n",
      "Mr. Gwynne, even if he is an Englishman, does not dress any better than\n",
      "Lyster.\"\n",
      "\"Not a bit. We shall have some jolly times together. Mr. Gwynne is very\n",
      "anxious to meet you.\"\n",
      "\"Well, he has not been in any particular hurry. Still, it will be\n",
      "fearfully nice, and I am so glad you have come down at last.\"\n",
      "XX\n",
      "It was characteristic of Mrs. Paula that she was not in the least\n",
      "jealous of Isabel's beauty. She was quite positive that no man would\n",
      "hesitate between her own exuberant prettiness and a face and form that\n",
      "looked as if it had stepped down from a dingy old canvas. It was true\n",
      "that Stone admired Isabel--with reservations to his wife--and had openly\n",
      "avowed his intention to paint her when he emerged from the tyranny of\n",
      "the pot-boiler. He had hoped that Isabel would take the graceful hint\n",
      "and order a portrait, but Isabel had succumbed to the pleadings of too\n",
      "many students of indifferent talent, and had no intention of undergoing\n",
      "the ordeal of sittings again to any but a master. To-night, as the party\n",
      "of four entered The Poodle Dog--the socially successful offspring of the\n",
      "still enterprising and disreputable parent on the dark slope\n",
      "above--Paula deliberately outstripped her companions and appropriated\n",
      "the seat, at the corner table reserved for them, that faced the room.\n",
      "Isabel was only too delighted to turn her back upon the staring people,\n",
      "for it had occurred to her to-night, for the first time, to be uneasily\n",
      "ashamed of her adopted relative. She had gone about with her several\n",
      "times since her return from Europe, and absently disapproved of a\n",
      "somewhat eccentric tendency in dress, but to all sorts of odd costuming\n",
      "she had grown accustomed during her experience of art circles abroad.\n",
      "This evening, as she stood in her living-room with Gwynne and watched\n",
      "Paula sail down the broad staircase, she had a sudden vision of the\n",
      "shanty at the northern base of Russian Hill where Mrs. Belmont had found\n",
      "her little Mexican seamstress, deserted by her American husband, wailing\n",
      "over the child she was about to leave. This story had always inspired\n",
      "Isabel with the profoundest pity, tempering her frequent impatience and\n",
      "disgust towards the family alien, but to-night she wished for a few\n",
      "moments that her mother had sent Paula to a foundling asylum. She\n",
      "glanced uneasily at Gwynne and fancied she could hear him slam the lid\n",
      "of his breeding upon a supercilious sputter. Mrs. Paula's skirt and the\n",
      "jacket on her arm were a respectable brown, but there was something in\n",
      "the screaming red blouse, the immense cheap red hat, the blazing cheeks,\n",
      "the pinched waist between swelling bust and hips, the already lifted\n",
      "skirt--Paula always wore a train that she might at the same time achieve\n",
      "longer lines and more subtle opportunities--exhibiting the pointed\n",
      "bronze slipper with a large red bow and much open work above, that\n",
      "suggested, if not the French cocotte, at least that San Francisco\n",
      "variety known in local parlance as \"South of Market Street Chippy.\" She\n",
      "did not bear the remotest likeness to a lady. She looked common, fast.\n",
      "Isabel wondered that she had never faced the truth before. It was as if\n",
      "a wave of final criticism heaved from the brain of the man whose life\n",
      "had been passed in the best societies of the world across to hers. But\n",
      "Gwynne was imperturbable and polite, and as they rode down-town in the\n",
      "bright cars Paula thought him \"fearfully nice\" and was quite sure that\n",
      "he admired her.\n",
      "\"We are fearfully late,\" she remarked, complacently, as she seated\n",
      "herself and looked slowly around the big room with its ornate frescoes\n",
      "and heavy chandeliers, its crowded tables and strange assortment of\n",
      "types. \"But it is much nicer--to see them all at once, I mean,\" she\n",
      "added, untruthfully.\n",
      "Gwynne, whose seat also commanded a view of the room, looked about him\n",
      "with much interest. He had a vague association of impropriety with the\n",
      "name of the restaurant, but he saw only a few painted females and\n",
      "queer-looking men. The majority looked as if they belonged to the higher\n",
      "walks of Bohemia, and quite a fourth were indubitably fashionable. But\n",
      "his more vivid impression was that they all looked gay and care-free,\n",
      "and that their personalities were not wholly obscured by clothes. After\n",
      "lunching or dining at one of the great New York restaurants he had\n",
      "carried away the impression of a tremendously fashionable school in\n",
      "uniform--the women distinguished in appearance beyond those of any other\n",
      "American city, but utterly unindividual. The social bodies of the United\n",
      "States had interested him little, but to-night he glanced about with\n",
      "something of the curiosity of a Columbus discovering the land of his\n",
      "fathers. No doubt his Otis great-grandfather had been intimate with the\n",
      "great-grandfathers of more than one man present; in this remote bit of\n",
      "civilization he almost felt as if he were sitting down with a company of\n",
      "relatives, at the least to a gathering of the clans. And he had rarely\n",
      "seen so many handsome women together, nor such a variety of types.\n",
      "Paula, who knew every one by sight and assiduously read the society\n",
      "papers, volunteered much information while Isabel ordered the dinner;\n",
      "Stone had been detained half-way down the room by a party of friends.\n",
      "\"That is Mrs. Masten,\" she whispered, with a respectful accent on the\n",
      "name and in the significant tone she always employed when addressing a\n",
      "person of social importance. \"The youngish tall woman with white hair\n",
      "and distinguished profile. She is one of the old set--the one Mrs.\n",
      "Belmont belonged to--and fearfully haughty. Some people call her a\n",
      "beauty, but how can a woman be a beauty with white hair? Lots get it\n",
      "here and lose their complexions before they are twenty-five. It is the\n",
      "wind and nerves and too many good times. I wonder I have not gone off\n",
      "too, but I take a nap every day no matter what happens. Just beyond is\n",
      "Mrs. Trennahan. She never did have any beauty with that sallow skin and\n",
      "no feature except her eyes; but her husband, who was a great swell in\n",
      "New York, and often takes her there, is quite devoted to her, and they\n",
      "have a house on Nob Hill and another in Menlo Park. She is so exclusive\n",
      "that it is a wonder she ever condescends to dine in a restaurant; but\n",
      "Mr. Trennahan is a fearfully high liver, and this kitchen is famous.\n",
      "Mrs. Trennahan's mother, Mrs. Yorba, who led society in the Eighties,\n",
      "had only ninety people on her visiting list, and they say that her\n",
      "parties were the dullest ever given in San Francisco. Of course that was\n",
      "before I was born. The glory of that prehistoric crowd has departed, in\n",
      "spite of the fact that a few of them--not many--have kept their\n",
      "fortunes--and they are nothing to the new ones. The Irish and Germans\n",
      "are on top now and are just ruling things--people whose very names our\n",
      "mothers never heard, although they were making their piles without\n",
      "saying much about it. They have come forward in the last five or six\n",
      "years with a rush. All the old leaders are dead, and their children\n",
      "don't seem to care much--just stand aside and put on airs. One of the\n",
      "new leaders has a brogue. And as for Mrs. Hofer--take a good look at\n",
      "her.\"\n",
      "Paula indicated a tall superbly proportioned young woman in a simple\n",
      "Parisian black gown and an immense black hat with a cascade of white\n",
      "feathers rolling over the brim; she had a round laughing face and an air\n",
      "of indescribable buoyancy. \"She was born and brought up south of Market\n",
      "Street, in the respectable part, but a dead give away in her generation:\n",
      "she's only twenty-six. I forget what her old peasant grandfather started\n",
      "life as, a peddler, probably, but afterwards he had a dry-goods store,\n",
      "or shoes or something, and he bought real estate, and his son improved\n",
      "it, so now they are rich. She was educated at the public schools, went\n",
      "to the University for a year, had two more in Europe, and came back with\n",
      "what they call presence and style, but is just cheek dressed up. She\n",
      "hadn't much show socially, but she didn't lose any time capturing\n",
      "Nicolas Hofer, the son of a German emigrant, who made money in the\n",
      "commission business which his sons have turned into millions. All the\n",
      "men like him, and as he was a great catch, of course he went everywhere;\n",
      "and when he married they had to accept his wife. She did the rest, and\n",
      "no one can deny that she is smart--in our sense and yours! She is a\n",
      "leader already, and has a perfectly wonderful house, that all the old\n",
      "aristocrats fall over themselves to get invited to. I'd like to go there\n",
      "myself, but of course I'm nobody. Hofer poses as a reformer, but I guess\n",
      "this old town's too much for him--\"\n",
      "\"Nicolas Hofer?\" asked Gwynne, with interest. \"I fancy that is the man\n",
      "my mother met at Homburg and asked me to call on.\"\n",
      "\"Oh!\" exclaimed Mrs. Paula, with a toss of her head. \"If you are going\n",
      "in for fine society you will soon have no use for us.\"\n",
      "Gwynne, being unaccustomed to crudities of this sort, applied himself to\n",
      "his oysters, while Isabel made a fierce resolution that she would find\n",
      "another chaperon or remain in the country. She was disagreeably\n",
      "conscious of craning necks, and although she knew that she was beginning\n",
      "to excite interest in San Francisco, and was looking her best in a white\n",
      "cloth frock and large white hat, she made no doubt that her\n",
      "juxtaposition to the exotic Paula was the theme of more than one\n",
      "unpleasant comment. While she liked Bohemia and was entirely indifferent\n",
      "to shabbiness, she had never grown accustomed to vulgarities, and that\n",
      "they should be embodied in her adopted sister filled her with a futile\n",
      "wrath.\n",
      "Stone hurried to his neglected party, waving his hand genially. He was a\n",
      "very tall loosely built man, with a sensuous laughing mouth and an eye\n",
      "that was seldom sober. He carried wine in his spirit as well as in his\n",
      "skin, and if the latter had bagged a trifle under its burden, the spirit\n",
      "was only depressed by the morning headache, and few men were more\n",
      "popular.\n",
      "\"Know what kept me?\" he demanded, as he doubled a huge Eastern\n",
      "oyster--for the others Isabel had ordered the more delicate Californian,\n",
      "but Stone's interior demanded a sterner nourishment. \"Isabel, you are\n",
      "famous. At first it was the men. Now it is the women too. It was like\n",
      "you, dearie, to put Isabel opposite that mirror where everybody can see\n",
      "her, but in which she looks just one decree further removed from common\n",
      "mortals. Takes an artist's wife! No use, my sister. The Eggopolis must\n",
      "take care of itself, the chickens be left to roost alone. San Francisco\n",
      "wants you, and what she wants she gets--what is the matter, darling?\"\n",
      "The corners of his little wife's mouth were down and her chin was\n",
      "trembling.\n",
      "\"You might have paid _me one_ compliment!\" she enunciated, between anger\n",
      "and tears.\n",
      "\"Good heavens, sweetheart, you are as familiar to them as Lotta's\n",
      "fountain. You are an old story--and always beautiful,\" he added,\n",
      "gallantly. \"But Isabel! We raise the voluptuous by the score, Gwynne,\n",
      "houris to beat the band. Climate's a regular Venus factory; but somehow\n",
      "we don't get the classic very often. Too mixed, probably. Will have to\n",
      "wait another generation or two. Eyes, complexions, figures--ye gods! But\n",
      "noses--somehow they run to snub. Still! Look over there. Ever see\n",
      "anything more fetching than those great Irish eyes in a regular little\n",
      "Dago mug? She's worth three cold millions and I pine to paint her. The\n",
      "price would be a mere detail. But to return to Isabel. She has only to\n",
      "raise her finger to become the rage, and I want her to raise it.\"\n",
      "\"I wonder how much they would care for her if she hadn't been born into\n",
      "one of the sacred old families, and hadn't money to boot!\" cried Mrs.\n",
      "Stone, exasperated beyond endurance by this triumph of marital\n",
      "tactlessness. \"I'd like to know what chance a poor girl has to turn\n",
      "people's heads--\"\n",
      "\"Tut! tut! Brownie, you're jealous. You know there never was a town\n",
      "where people cared less about money--\"\n",
      "\"It's just like any other old town, only you have silly legends about it\n",
      "that you stick to in the face of facts. That day Isabel took me to the\n",
      "St. Francis for lunch I never saw so many stuck-up-looking girls in my\n",
      "life, and they all looked as if they had just sailed out of New York\n",
      "fashion-plates. There are only about six really fashionable women here\n",
      "to-night, and they only come because they think it's spicy to get so\n",
      "close to real vice without actually touching it. For my part I'm sick of\n",
      "the whole Bohemian game, and I'd like to dine at The St. Francis or The\n",
      "Palace every night.\" She turned to Gwynne, her eyes flashing\n",
      "dramatically; she was tired of being chorus to her popular husband's\n",
      "leading roles, and was determined to hold the centre of the stage for\n",
      "Gwynne's edification at least. \"They pretend to come here because the\n",
      "dinner is so good!\" she exclaimed. \"Good and cheap! But it isn't that a\n",
      "bit with the swells--the women, that is. They just love the idea of\n",
      "doing something almost naughty, once in a while in their virtuous\n",
      "lives--when a San Francisco woman _is_ proper she'd make you really\n",
      "tired with her superior airs and censorious tongue; but there isn't much\n",
      "she doesn't know, all the same, and she just revels in venturing this\n",
      "far.\"\n",
      "\"I don't understand,\" said the bewildered Englishman. \"Are we dining in\n",
      "a dive?\"\n",
      "\"Not quite, but almost!\" cried Stone, refilling his glass from the large\n",
      "bottle in ice. \"There is only one San Francisco! We have about six of\n",
      "these French restaurants--ever taste anything like these frogs in Paris?\n",
      "You scarcely ever see anybody in them at this hour with an 'all-night'\n",
      "reputation. There are plenty of other resorts, a good many of them under\n",
      "the sidewalks, where the dinner is almost as good but where a man\n",
      "doesn't take his wife. And up-stairs--here--and in a few others--well,\n",
      "if a woman is seen entering by the side door she is done for. But then\n",
      "she isn't usually seen. Lord! if these walls could speak! The\n",
      "divorce-mills would explode. The waiters all invest in real estate.\n",
      "Policemen send their daughters to Europe, and the boss politicians get\n",
      "rich so fast they spend money almost like a gentleman. In the hotels you\n",
      "are all but asked for your marriage license, but in what is\n",
      "euphemistically known as the French restaurants--well, high-toned vice\n",
      "comes high, but the town is fairly bursting with accommodations for\n",
      "every purse. No town like this!\" he exclaimed, gazing into his lifted\n",
      "glass and with the accent of deep feeling. \"No town on God's footstool.\n",
      "Nothing like it. Wouldn't live anywhere else if you gave me the planet.\n",
      "Of course I've reformed, but then it's the _atmosphere_--not a taint of\n",
      "American Puritanism--European and something more--the wild flavor of a\n",
      "new and unique civilization. Precious few California men that go to New\n",
      "York to live but are too glad to come back; and Eastern men, like\n",
      "Trennahan, who have had a long taste of it, couldn't be paid to live\n",
      "anywhere else.\"\n",
      "\"So all the legends of San Francisco are true?\" said Gwynne, who\n",
      "preferred Stone to his wife.\n",
      "\"Couldn't exaggerate if you tried. Wait till I show it to you. No blazed\n",
      "trail nor special policeman detailed to protect our precious skulls. I\n",
      "know the ropes and am not afraid to go anywhere.\"\n",
      "\"How do you like your new work?\" asked Isabel, hastily, not knowing what\n",
      "he might say next. \"I should fancy that newspaper life would suit you.\"\n",
      "\"Does! Never hit a job I liked as well. Jolly set of fellows. Up all\n",
      "night. What more could a fellow ask? No more aristocracy of art for me.\n",
      "I'm neither a Peters nor a Keith, and I wish I'd found it out ten years\n",
      "ago. If a man can make a good living, what in--ah, what on earth more\n",
      "can he want in a town that gives him the best things in the world to\n",
      "eat, the jolliest all-night life, the finest fellows in the world, the\n",
      "prettiest women to look at, a climate that puts new life into old\n",
      "horses--life's a dead easy game out here--when you don't develop too\n",
      "much ambition. Ambition? Nothing in that. Fellows are ingrates and\n",
      "idiots that go off to a cold-blooded place like New York, with a beastly\n",
      "climate, the moment they have made a little mark here. No philosophy in\n",
      "ambition. Only one life. Why not enjoy it--when your creditors will let\n",
      "you? And the money always comes somehow--comes easy, goes easy, and if\n",
      "we can't all be great, we can be happier here than anywhere else on\n",
      "earth. Here's to San Francisco--and perdition to him that calls it\n",
      "'Frisco!\"\n",
      "\"So you have said good-bye to ambition?\" asked Isabel, curiously. \"I\n",
      "used to think you had a good deal.\"\n",
      "\"So I had. Once I was younger and knew less. Perhaps if I had ever done\n",
      "anything cleverer than a few dashing skits for the Bohemian Club, and\n",
      "somebody had patted me hard enough on the back, I might have made an ass\n",
      "of myself and crossed the continent in the wake of so many that have\n",
      "never been heard of since.\"\n",
      "\"I don't think you ever gave your creativeness a real chance. If you had\n",
      "shut yourself up in the country for a year--\"\n",
      "\"I should have stayed a week. Scenery on a drop curtain is all I want of\n",
      "nature. No, Isabel.\" He relapsed into sadness for a moment. \"I have\n",
      "travelled the logical road and simmered down into my place. It's just\n",
      "this: San Francisco breeds all sorts. A few are born with a drop of\n",
      "iron in their souls. They resist the climate, and the enchantment of the\n",
      "easy luxurious semi-idle life you can command out here on next to\n",
      "nothing, and clear out, and work hard, and make little old California\n",
      "famous. Where they get the iron from God knows. It's all electricity\n",
      "with the rest of us. There are hundreds of my sort. You've seen them at\n",
      "the real Bohemian restaurants; young men mad with life and the sense of\n",
      "their own powers; all of them writing, painting, composing,\n",
      "editing--mostly talking. Then at other tables the old-young men who\n",
      "have shrugged their shoulders and simmered down like myself; lucky if\n",
      "they haven't taken to drink or drugs to drown regrets. Still other\n",
      "tables--the young-old men, quite happy, and generally drunk. Business\n",
      "men and some professional are the only ones that forge steadily ahead;\n",
      "with precious few exceptions. But you don't see them often in the cheap\n",
      "Bohemian restaurants, which have a glamour for the young, and are a\n",
      "financial necessity for the failures. Never was such a high percentage\n",
      "of brains in any one city. But they must get out. And if they don't go\n",
      "young they don't go at all. San Francisco is a disease. You can't shake\n",
      "it off. And you don't want to. To Hades with ambition anyhow,\" he cried,\n",
      "gayly. \"We can admire one another--and we've learned to, instead of\n",
      "knocking the life out of everybody else as we did a few years ago. Now\n",
      "we present the unique spectacle of a city packed to the brim with\n",
      "cleverness and always ready for more. We know how to appreciate. _Vive\n",
      "la bagatelle._ New York? Why, the spirit and brains would be drained out\n",
      "of nine-tenths of us trying to keep a roof over our heads, and nobody\n",
      "knowing we were there. No, _sir_. No, _madam_! The men in this town\n",
      "realize more and more when they are well off, and here is one of them.\"\n",
      "And he refilled his glass.\n",
      "Isabel, not knowing that she had been listening to the litany of wasted\n",
      "lives, turned in disgust and cast about for an excuse to leave before\n",
      "Stone ordered another bottle of champagne. She encountered a gleam of\n",
      "amusement in Gwynne's eyes, and it seemed to transfer her to an empty\n",
      "auditorium, while mankind performed its little tricks on the stage for\n",
      "her sole benefit. It was a subtle tribute, and she blushed under it. She\n",
      "was also gratified to observe that Paula was boring him. But she glanced\n",
      "away, lest he should think she had forgiven him. At the same moment she\n",
      "saw a young man that had sat with his back to them, and opposite the\n",
      "famous Mrs. Hofer, suddenly push back his chair, rise to his feet, and\n",
      "look sharply at Gwynne. Then he came rapidly down the room, and Gwynne\n",
      "rose and met him as if lifted to his feet by the hospitality beaming\n",
      "from the large bright shrewd capable face of the Californian.\n",
      "\"This is Mr. Gwynne! Is it really?\" he exclaimed, taking the stranger's\n",
      "hand in a large warm grasp. \"I am Nicolas Hofer. Your mother wrote you?\n",
      "We have only been back a short time--I had intended running up to see\n",
      "you. I knew you for a Britisher the minute you entered the room, but the\n",
      "word was only just passed about who you were. Do--please--waive\n",
      "formality and lunch with me at my house to-morrow. Then we'll motor\n",
      "about a bit and I'll show you something of the city. Glad the fine\n",
      "weather holds out. No denial. I expect you.\" And he skilfully took\n",
      "himself off, before Gwynne should feel obliged to introduce him to his\n",
      "party.\n",
      "\"Now, what do you think of that for California manners, and the\n",
      "arrogance of the rich?\" demanded Paula, triumphantly.\n",
      "\"Not a bit of it,\" replied Stone, amiably. \"Man was in a hurry. Can't\n",
      "you see his wife waiting for him? Never knew a Californian to put on\n",
      "airs in my life.\" By this time his optimism was complete. \"Only women\n",
      "imagine such things. There are as many poor as rich in San Francisco\n",
      "society. Only some of us are too poor, and Bohemia is better anyway.\n",
      "Well, let's hit the pike. This room is too hot for my head.\"\n",
      "XXI\n",
      "The Poodle Dog, a high new ugly building, stood on the corner of Eddy\n",
      "and Mason Streets in the very centre of the Tenderloin, or \"all night\n",
      "district.\" For two or three blocks on every side there was a blaze of\n",
      "light, electric signs, illuminated windows, sudden flashes from swinging\n",
      "doors. There was much movement, life, laughter, carriages in the street\n",
      "driving from restaurant to theatre. And all beyond, east and west, south\n",
      "and north, was a city as dark and quiet as the grave. The hill tops were\n",
      "picked out with a few lights, but one could barely see them from this\n",
      "region that never slept. Nor could one see Chinatown and Barbary coast,\n",
      "nor other sections more picturesque than creditable, where the cheaper\n",
      "gas blazed late, and not even a policeman was sure of his morrow if he\n",
      "ventured too far. But here was the sound of music and decorous laughter,\n",
      "the clang of street-cars and the constant rattle of carriages: the\n",
      "restaurants were beginning to empty; there would be an hour or two of\n",
      "comparative quiet, and then another crowd would fill the streets, the\n",
      "restaurants, even the saloons; a crowd that rarely saw daylight mixing\n",
      "amiably with respectable but undomestic citizens that could afford to\n",
      "sleep late.\n",
      "At present the scene was brilliant. \"The San Franciscan loves the\n",
      "outside life as much as the Londoner,\" said Isabel to Gwynne, as they\n",
      "stood a moment almost blinded by the lower signs. \"In many ways you\n",
      "will find them not unlike--especially as regards fads. Wait until you\n",
      "have been really initiated into intellectual Bohemia--the clever young\n",
      "newspaper men and budding authors. I already hate the names of Ibsen,\n",
      "Shaw, Wilde, Symons, Maeterlinck, and Gorky. I am only waiting for them\n",
      "to discover Max Klinger and Manet--\"\n",
      "\"Klinger?\" asked Stone. \"Where have I heard that name?\"\n",
      "\"He is the great unconscious humorist of modern art, also a great\n",
      "etcher,\" said Isabel, dryly. \"Have you ever heard of the\n",
      "_Secessionists_?\"\n",
      "\"Of course,\" replied Stone, huffily. \"You imagine that because you have\n",
      "been to Europe--\"\n",
      "\"Well, _have_ you ever heard of the _Scholles_?\"\n",
      "Gwynne laughed aloud. \"If he has not, I should champion the octopus\n",
      "proclivities of California.\"\n",
      "\"They are the very best draughtsmen in the world--\"\n",
      "But Paula had no intention that the conversation should be general. It\n",
      "had been agreed that they should visit Chinatown, and she took Gwynne's\n",
      "arm and led him up the hill; she found his cool impersonal manner almost\n",
      "fascinating after a lifetime in a nest of horned egos. They walked up\n",
      "through the semi-darkness to Clay Street and down to Portsmouth Square,\n",
      "passing through an entirely disreputable region, but quiet at this hour.\n",
      "As they crossed the Old Plaza--now Portsmouth Square--Isabel explained\n",
      "that it had been the nucleus of the San Francisco of the Fifties, and\n",
      "that people had crowded nightly against the great plate-glass windows on\n",
      "one of the corners to watch the gamblers and the hillocks of gold on\n",
      "every table; and that no doubt their common ancestor, who was a\n",
      "convivial adventurous soul, had brawled here many a night. Mrs. Paula,\n",
      "who knew absolutely nothing of the history of either California or San\n",
      "Francisco, hastened her steps, and in consequence excited the always\n",
      "smouldering jealousy of her husband. Stone had an exaggerated idea of\n",
      "her beauty and youth, and felt his own power waning, moreover had all\n",
      "the average American's Oriental instinct for exclusive possession.\n",
      "Consequently, as they entered the flaming bit of Hong-Kong on the\n",
      "opposite side of the square, Gwynne, infinitely to his satisfaction,\n",
      "found that there had been a deft exchange of partners.\n",
      "He had been in China, and the sudden entrance into an illusion more\n",
      "complete than even the stage could achieve almost took his breath away.\n",
      "There were the same crowds of stolid faces and dark-blue blouses,\n",
      "relieved here and there with the rich garments of the merchants and the\n",
      "women; the hundreds of tiny high balconies; the gorgeous windows filled\n",
      "with embroideries and porcelain, Satsuma and bronzes. He was glad to\n",
      "stroll with Isabel through a scene so like a picture-book, and to\n",
      "exclaim with her over the novel sensation of passing from the\n",
      "quintessence of the Western world into a bit of ancient civilization.\n",
      "She realized the psychology of every violent contrast as no companion he\n",
      "had ever known, and when she told him of the adjacent Spanish Town,\n",
      "Little Italy, Nigger Town, Sailor Town, where representatives of the\n",
      "scum of every clime were no doubt qualifying for purgatory at the\n",
      "moment, he experienced a lively regret that there were places he must\n",
      "explore without her comment.\n",
      "It was a gala night in Chinatown. Even the provision shops were\n",
      "festooned with sausages ornamented with bits of colored paper, and\n",
      "decorated paper or silken lanterns hung before every house. Painted\n",
      "women with stolid faces, often deeply imprinted with misery, rolled\n",
      "along, and there were many pretty children in the street, painted too,\n",
      "and dressed in the gayest and richest of garments. On the balconies of\n",
      "the upper and greater restaurants were valuable jars and vases full of\n",
      "plants and flowers. They ascended to the finest of these restaurants and\n",
      "found a merchant's party eating at round tables from dolls' plates. In a\n",
      "room opening upon a veranda, their creatures chanted what sounded to\n",
      "Occidental ears like the dirge of the lost souls of all the Flowery\n",
      "Empire, and the expression of the relaxed haunted faces confirmed the\n",
      "impression. In large alcoves well-dressed Chinamen reclined on tables of\n",
      "marble and teakwood, filling and refilling the opium pipe with an\n",
      "infinity of patience that if otherwise applied might have led to\n",
      "greatness instead of dreams.\n",
      "\"These men are just on exhibition,\" said Stone, contemptuously. \"Wait\n",
      "till I show you the real thing down in the slime. Lots of tall stories\n",
      "about Chinatown, but the reality is bad enough.\"\n",
      "They took a Jackson Street car and rode up through humbler Chinatown,\n",
      "then through quarters of varying respectability until they reached the\n",
      "sacred precinct of Nob Hill. Here there was an aristocratic calm, but\n",
      "much light, and faint strains of music. The season was in full swing,\n",
      "and society was either dining, or dressing for the dance.\n",
      "As they climbed the hill-stair Stone artfully trimmed the ragged edges\n",
      "of his wife's discontent. Subservient as she was to him, there were\n",
      "times when her temper flew straight and sharp like a blade too long\n",
      "hooped, and he had his reasons for conciliating her.\n",
      "Said Gwynne in a low tone as they felt their way up the dark and\n",
      "precarious flight: \"Shall you think me rude if I accept Hofer's\n",
      "invitation for to-morrow? And Stone wants me to do the town a bit\n",
      "to-night. I am most curious--but I am your guest--and I can come down\n",
      "another time--\"\n",
      "\"I feel almost cross with you. This house is your hotel. If you ever go\n",
      "to another--whether I am in town or not--there will be trouble.\"\n",
      "So it was that as they reached the steps leading up to the door of the\n",
      "house, Stone dropped his wife's arm, which had lain somewhat rigidly in\n",
      "his, and catching Gwynne firmly by the elbow, beat a rapid retreat.\n",
      "\"Good-night, darling!\" he cried. \"We're off to do the town.\" Throwing up\n",
      "first one leg then the other in black silhouette against the stars, he\n",
      "sang: \"And we won't be home till morning, till morning--\"\n",
      "The voice drifted up from the corner of Taylor and Broadway, where the\n",
      "two men waited for a car. \"Till daylight doth appear.\"\n",
      "Mrs. Paula was gasping. \"Well, I never--never--\" she exclaimed, as\n",
      "Isabel hastily marshalled her up the stair and into the house. \"I hope\n",
      "they'll be garroted! That's all! But it's just like the selfish beasts\n",
      "of men--\"\n",
      "\"What difference does it make? Didn't Lyster agree to be host? It would\n",
      "be too dismal for Gwynne to roam through the purlieus with a\n",
      "policeman--and he cannot come down often. It's bedtime, anyhow.\"\n",
      "\"Bedtime?\" cried Mrs. Paula. \"Why, it's only ten o'clock. But I forgot\n",
      "that you go to bed and get up with chickens.\"\n",
      "\"I should think you would be grateful to go to bed early, once in a\n",
      "while.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, I often retire early enough, if it comes to that. It's listening\n",
      "half the night--all, is more like it--for the last car, and then for a\n",
      "hack galloping from side to side up that hill, as if the driver and the\n",
      "very horses were drunk themselves. I tell you it's a life!\"\n",
      "\"And don't you get used to it?\" asked Isabel with curiosity. \"You've\n",
      "been married thirteen years, and I suppose Lyster has always been what\n",
      "he calls an all-nighter.\"\n",
      "\"There are some things a wife never gets used to,\" replied Paula with\n",
      "injured dignity, as she held out a doubting hand for the candle Isabel\n",
      "had lighted. \"Haven't you gas or electricity?\"\n",
      "\"There is gas, but why take the trouble to light it? And the candle\n",
      "recalls so many delightful evenings in England. I know no prettier\n",
      "picture than a procession of long-trained women, with bare shoulders,\n",
      "and jewels in their hair, each carrying a candle up a long stair beside\n",
      "the central hall.\"\n",
      "\"Ah! I have no such charming reminiscences of the English aristocracy,\n",
      "and I am only afraid of spilling candle grease on my one decent dress.\"\n",
      "XXII\n",
      "At four o'clock Isabel was awakened by suspicious sounds at the key-hole\n",
      "of the front door. She reached out for her pistol, but withdrew her hand\n",
      "as she heard the careless laugh of her brother-in-law. A few moments\n",
      "later the two explorers, after an instant's hesitation at the head of\n",
      "the stair--which they had climbed like cats--walked past her door with a\n",
      "brisk swaggering preternaturally steady gait that invoked the memory of\n",
      "former occupants of the mansion. Then Gwynne's door opened and shut as\n",
      "if by sleight of hand. Stone's was at the end of the hall. Isabel\n",
      "inferred that he went through it, and a sound between a hiss and a\n",
      "smothered roar shot down the hall as he would seem to pick up the door\n",
      "and bang it into place.\n",
      "Mr. Hofer had mentioned his luncheon hour as half-past one. Isabel had\n",
      "Gwynne called an hour before. She was sitting on the veranda, as he\n",
      "emerged. He was as well groomed as usual, but he was unmistakably pale\n",
      "beneath his new coat of tan. She laughed wickedly.\n",
      "\"Oh yes,\" he said, imperturbably, \"I was drunk. If I had not been I\n",
      "never could have got through it, not being a seasoned San Franciscan. I\n",
      "thought I knew vice. I have seen a good many variations, and in places\n",
      "where protection was necessary. But I had not guessed at the\n",
      "combination of ancient civilization and the crudities of the mining-camp\n",
      "in the heart of a modern city. Stone is not a tank, but a camel. I\n",
      "befuddled myself successfully in those dives under the pavements--and we\n",
      "had by no means begun there: I should say we had patronized at least\n",
      "half the saloons in San Francisco before we started for the underworld.\n",
      "As we finally supported each other up the hill--we hadn't the price of a\n",
      "cab left between us--it seemed to me that I was ascending from a jungle\n",
      "of antediluvian men and women and beasts for ever and ever on the\n",
      "rampage. San Francisco is the most wonderful city in the world inasmuch\n",
      "as she not only exists but thrives on the top of such outrageous\n",
      "rottenness. And no wonder that the men like Hofer are desperate. We were\n",
      "escorted by a policeman after all, and he seemed to enjoy himself. The\n",
      "flash of knives--I saw two men stuck--made as little impression upon him\n",
      "as the awful abandonment of--well, of the females. Good God!--Well, I\n",
      "hope another variety is in store to-day. Hofer, at least, does not\n",
      "appear to be dissipated.\"\n",
      "\"Oh no, it is the fashion in that set to be domestic and good citizens.\n",
      "All you'll hear of the underworld to-day will be its relation to\n",
      "politics. They have been making a desperate fight to defeat the present\n",
      "mayor's reelection and have been overwhelmingly defeated. The mayor is\n",
      "popularly supposed to be a criminal at large, and the party that\n",
      "supports him call themselves socialists, and are labor unions more\n",
      "greedy and tyrannical than any Trust in the country. Nice town. But we\n",
      "are optimists. No doubt Mr. Hofer and his party are already planning for\n",
      "the next campaign. If I were a man, I'd go back to the tactics of the\n",
      "Fifties and lynch. The city had good government for twenty years after\n",
      "the operations of that Vigilance Committee. You might suggest it.\"\n",
      "\"I cannot say that I am in a suggesting mood. Shall you be here to\n",
      "dinner?\"\n",
      "\"Probably. But you are to accept whatever offers. No doubt Mr. Hofer\n",
      "will motor you out to the Country Club or down to Burlingame, where he\n",
      "has a house.\"\n",
      "Gwynne nodded gratefully and left her. As he reached the top of the\n",
      "steps leading down the hill, Isabel saw him pause and speak to a very\n",
      "tall very smart young woman, whom she recognized in a moment as Mrs.\n",
      "Hofer. Then the young matron advanced along the board walk with a sort\n",
      "of trembling stride. It was evident from her charming blushing face that\n",
      "she was as embarrassed as any one so young and buoyant, so successful\n",
      "and so Irish, could be. Isabel ran down the steps to meet her.\n",
      "\"Oh!\" cried Mrs. Hofer, in a light, high, cultivated, but nasal voice,\n",
      "with a slightly English accent. \"You _are_ sweet! I had intended to call\n",
      "in state the first time I could think of a decent excuse, for I have\n",
      "simply been mad--_mad_--to know you. But last night I told Mr. Hofer\n",
      "that my slender stock of patience had gone--flown--evaporated. I could\n",
      "hardly wait till this afternoon! Do you think I'm unconventional? I'm\n",
      "not really, except when I'm abroad--never here. Nobody is so\n",
      "conventional as the San Franciscan at home.\"\n",
      "Isabel was smiling and trying to guide her up the steps. \"I am more glad\n",
      "than I can say to know you, at last,\" she said. \"Do come into my house.\"\n",
      "\"Let me rest a bit. The breath is out of me with the climb and the\n",
      "fright. Yes, fright, and it takes a good deal to phaze me. But you're\n",
      "the sensation of the town, my dear. There have been all sorts of plans\n",
      "to get hold of you. People are simply mad--_mad_! I was just bound I'd\n",
      "be the first. Not petty social ambition, not a bit of it. I wanted to\n",
      "know you. And I stayed in a country-house in England just after you,\n",
      "last year. To think that you could have married Lord Hexam. Oh, what a\n",
      "jewel of a house! I went simply mad over those white rooms in London.\"\n",
      "Isabel had firmly piloted her up the steps and into the house, and Mrs.\n",
      "Hofer sat on the edge of a chair like a bird on a bough, her merry\n",
      "shrewd sweet eyes devouring Isabel's face.\n",
      "\"Oh, but I've wanted to know you! You don't know what this means to me!\"\n",
      "\"But why?\" asked Isabel, much amused. \"I am nobody.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, just aren't you, though? Why, you're almost the last of the old San\n",
      "Francisco Knickerbockers, so to speak. That is, the last that has\n",
      "inherited any of the beauty one is always hearing about from the old\n",
      "beaux. And most of them have gone under anyhow--in the cheerful\n",
      "California fashion: three generations from shirt sleeves to shirt\n",
      "sleeves. Of course there are some left, but the most interesting thing\n",
      "about them is that they have been forced to open their houses to the\n",
      "likes of us--or sit down and talk to empty chairs. But the old Spanish\n",
      "blood is what interests us most. It was quite forgotten--all that old\n",
      "life--for about two generations; but now it's the fashion to remember\n",
      "it, and everything else early Californian. To think that you are a\n",
      "niece, so to speak, of the first nun in California, who had that\n",
      "romantic love affair with that Russian--I never could pronounce his\n",
      "name. That's not what interests _me_ most, though. It's _you_. To think\n",
      "what you've done! Those chickens! My man in the market has orders to\n",
      "send me Old Inn chickens and eggs, on penalty of losing my custom. All\n",
      "the _blasee_ girls--the San Francisco girls _do_ get so _blasee_, poor\n",
      "things--are threatening to go in for chickens. It would be a lot better\n",
      "for them than bridge. It is quite shocking the way they do gamble. Talk\n",
      "about early times!\"\n",
      "\"Fancy chickens becoming a fad!\" Mrs. Hofer had paused for breath. \"Poor\n",
      "chickens! Tell your friends that they will have to get up at all hours\n",
      "of the night, and at six o'clock in winter, and five in summer, and\n",
      "spend a large part of their time in overalls and rubber boots. I fancy\n",
      "that will cure them.\"\n",
      "\"It would! No more flirtations! No more Paris gowns! No more paint! I'll\n",
      "tell them. But they admire you, all the same. And we are all dying to\n",
      "see you _en grande tenue_. I am giving a ball the night before\n",
      "Christmas. Say you will come--right here, on the spot.\"\n",
      "\"I shall love to come. I had intended to reopen this house as soon as I\n",
      "could afford it, and had hardly expected to pick up my mother's old\n",
      "threads until then. But a ball! I haven't danced for a year.\"\n",
      "\"It is simply fine to hear you say things just like other girls, when\n",
      "you look the concentrated essence of all our bewigged and bepowdered\n",
      "ancestors. To think that you've got that old colonial blood in you too,\n",
      "and are related to a lot of those old duffers one sees in the public\n",
      "parks. The next time I go East I'll look at them with more interest.\"\n",
      "Then she sat still farther forward, and her bright face took on an\n",
      "expression of coaxing eagerness.\n",
      "\"If it hadn't been a man's luncheon to-day I should have asked you to\n",
      "join us. But won't you come down to The St. Francis with me? My\n",
      "automobile is at the foot of the bluff. We can motor afterward through\n",
      "the park a bit, and out on the boulevard. It is a simply heavenly day.\"\n",
      "Isabel hesitated, and lifted an ear to the floor above. There was not a\n",
      "sound, nor was it likely that Lyster would make his appearance before\n",
      "dinner. Paula had announced her intention of visiting her children in\n",
      "the course of the afternoon; she would hardly awaken for luncheon. While\n",
      "she hesitated Mrs. Hofer began to coax in her eager commanding fashion.\n",
      "\"Oh, do come! Please come! I'm mad, _mad_ to have you all to myself for\n",
      "one day. Chloroform them--\"\n",
      "\"You wouldn't lunch with me?\"\n",
      "\"I _will_ entertain you first. Please, please, come!\"\n",
      "\"Very well,\" said Isabel, laughing. \"I doubt if they ever know the\n",
      "difference. I won't be a minute getting ready.\"\n",
      "She ran up-stairs, and during the half-hour of her toilette Mrs. Hofer\n",
      "examined everything in the down-stairs rooms and nodded an emphatic\n",
      "approval.\n",
      "XXIII\n",
      "It was nearly midnight. Isabel, her head still buzzing after a\n",
      "kaleidoscopic day, which included much motoring and many words, felt no\n",
      "inclination for bed, moreover was not only curious to hear Gwynne's\n",
      "impressions, but felt a pleasant sense of anticipation in talking the\n",
      "day over with him. He had telephoned that he was going down to\n",
      "Burlingame for dinner, but should manage to return to the house in the\n",
      "neighborhood of midnight. She wondered if he had met as many people and\n",
      "received as many bewildering impressions as she had done.\n",
      "If she had cherished a lingering delusion that aught remained of the old\n",
      "proud reserved character of the society of her mother's time, it had\n",
      "vanished before the chatter of her hostess and the experiences of the\n",
      "day. They had not lunched at The St. Francis, after all. As they reached\n",
      "the entrance Mrs. Hofer capriciously changed her mind, and decided to\n",
      "make a dramatic descent with Isabel upon the house of a friend whom she\n",
      "knew to be entertaining informally, and where she was always sure of a\n",
      "welcome. The house was out at The Mission, a generic term in these days\n",
      "for the valley under the shadow of Twin Peaks, so sparsely populated by\n",
      "the _padres_. There were still a few large wooden houses, surrounded by\n",
      "grounds, that looked like country seats in the midst of that wilderness\n",
      "of cheap and hideous streets; built perhaps thirty or forty years\n",
      "before, when \"The Mission\" was a suburb, and for old affection's sake\n",
      "still inhabited in spite of a thousand drawbacks. Isabel approached this\n",
      "place in a fever of anticipation, for it was none other than the old\n",
      "estate of Juan Moraga, and through a grille in its vanished adobe wall\n",
      "Concha Argueello had held tryst with her Russian lover, Rezanov.\n",
      "Into this sheltered valley the trade winds and the fog came so seldom\n",
      "that, although it was a November day, the host had no hesitation in\n",
      "entertaining his guests on the lawn, with rugs under foot and a canopy\n",
      "to protect the complexions of the women. Here, Isabel found members of\n",
      "nearly every set the city had ever possessed: Mrs. Trennahan, like\n",
      "herself of the old Spanish stock, and her New York husband; Anne\n",
      "Montgomery and two or three others of the second regime; Catalina Shore,\n",
      "with her beautiful half Indian face and English husband; these few with\n",
      "a repose of manner that looked old-fashioned against the lightly poised\n",
      "figures and incessant chatter of the younger girls. And there was an\n",
      "even greater variety of garb. Several were dressed for the season in\n",
      "velvet and furs: one wore an organdie blouse and hat; another had\n",
      "hastily donned a checked travelling suit; there was no doubt that Miss\n",
      "Montgomery had bought her simple brown frock already made, and perhaps\n",
      "at a sale; her neighbor wore a black lace dress with a fur boa. The\n",
      "majority were excessively smart, whatever their vagaries, and Mrs.\n",
      "Hofer, most of all, in several shades of gray; not only becoming to her\n",
      "dark hair and bright color, but suggesting the natural plumage of a\n",
      "bird; she was one of those women that look so well in whatever they wear\n",
      "that it is difficult to imagine them in anything else. Isabel, perhaps,\n",
      "although the sharp eye of a woman would have detected the absence of the\n",
      "hand of a maid in her toilette, more nearly solved the problem of a\n",
      "spring day in mid-winter, with her frock of white serge and large black\n",
      "hat covered with feathers.\n",
      "She sat between the \"Reform Mayor,\" whose guest she was, and the\n",
      "\"Militant Editor,\" neither in the highest spirits after their recent and\n",
      "unexpected defeat; and heard much of that intimate political talk for\n",
      "which she had longed, although her mind wandered occasionally to that\n",
      "romantic past of caballero and dona not yet a century old, very\n",
      "difficult to conjure in this swarming heterogeneous valley.\n",
      "After luncheon Mrs. Hofer had invited Miss Montgomery into the\n",
      "automobile, and taken her and Isabel for a long ride, chattering of\n",
      "everything under the sun, but with breathing spells that enabled Isabel\n",
      "to exchange a few remarks with her old friend; and between remorse for\n",
      "her own neglect and pity for that desolated life, she was almost\n",
      "effusive, and begged Miss Montgomery to visit her in the valley where\n",
      "Anne's father too had owned a ranch in palmier days. She offered to\n",
      "furnish a room immediately, and Miss Montgomery smilingly promised to\n",
      "obtain surcease from dinner-parties, where her portion was to enter by\n",
      "the back door--in nine cases out of ten with the ancestral silver--and\n",
      "take the rest she needed. She made a good living, she assured Isabel,\n",
      "but was educating a young relative for the navy, and lived in a flat\n",
      "that was largely kitchen. All her fragile wild-rose beauty was gone long\n",
      "since, but she still remembered how to put on her clothes, and her\n",
      "position was unaffected in that devil-may-care city; she went into\n",
      "society when she chose.\n",
      "Mrs. Hofer, on their return from the environs, left them for a few\n",
      "moments in front of a house on Van Ness Avenue where a friend lay ill,\n",
      "and Isabel made an enthusiastic allusion to the gay out-door appearance\n",
      "of the city. The broad avenue was crowded with men, women, and children,\n",
      "promenading in the sunshine. Every street-car was filled with people on\n",
      "their way to or from the Park, Presidio, or Cliff House. They had passed\n",
      "hundreds of automobiles and fine turnouts of every description, and out\n",
      "at the three great resorts thousands of pleasure-seekers.\n",
      "Miss Montgomery set her well-cut mouth in a pale line. \"I get somewhat\n",
      "weary of all this pagan delight in mere externals,\" she remarked. \"It is\n",
      "all so superficial and deceptive, although sincere enough in its\n",
      "ebullitions. I can tell you, my dear idealist--you have not changed a\n",
      "particle, by the way--that there is another side you have never seen. I\n",
      "doubt if you ever would see it, even if you came to live in the town.\"\n",
      "The automobile stood on a corner. Miss Montgomery indicated the rise and\n",
      "fall of the hill-side, east and west of the avenue. \"Look at all those\n",
      "shabby-genteel rows of houses, each exactly like the next, each with its\n",
      "awful bow window, and all needing a new coat of paint. So are the lives\n",
      "inside. And there are miles of them. There are just four sorts of people\n",
      "in this town--ignoring its underworld--that get any real enjoyment out\n",
      "of life: those that are wealthy enough to command constant variety; the\n",
      "careless clever Bohemians with their wits always on the alert and plenty\n",
      "of congenial work; the club women; the laboring class, that get the\n",
      "highest wages on earth and are as happy as beasts of the field on a\n",
      "bright warm winter's day like this. But oh, the thousands and thousands\n",
      "of mere mortals that are mired in their ruts and no longer even plan to\n",
      "climb out! There is no more chance for those people--who are in some\n",
      "little business, or are clerks, or small professional men, or fractions\n",
      "in the great corporations--to mention but a few examples--no more chance\n",
      "for them than in any of the older cities; for San Francisco has gone at\n",
      "such a pace that she has as many ruts as if centuries had plowed her,\n",
      "and those in the ruts might as well be on Lone Mountain. They--the women\n",
      "particularly--have the tedium vitae in an acuter form than you have seen\n",
      "anywhere in Europe, for over there the centuries have mellowed and\n",
      "enriched life; there is something besides this eternal climate which can\n",
      "never take the place of art. Of course there was a day when every man\n",
      "had an equal chance, but that day has passed long since. And then in\n",
      "Europe,\" she went on, the minor note in her voice becoming more\n",
      "plaintive, although she was too well bred to whine, \"you are always near\n",
      "some other place. You can save your money for a few months and command a\n",
      "change of scene. Here you have to travel three thousand miles to find a\n",
      "change of accent. I often have the delusion that California is on Mars.\n",
      "And the climate! Day after day, when I walk down that shabby hill with\n",
      "menus revolving in my head, or take the boat across that sparkling\n",
      "bay--I have customers all about--I long for the extremes of seasons they\n",
      "have in the East--fogs and four months of intermittent rain are only an\n",
      "irritant to one's natural love of variety. I long for the excitement of\n",
      "wading through snow drifts. I wish we would have a war. I should love\n",
      "to hear the shells hissing overhead, to see great buildings collapse,\n",
      "people rushing about in a mad state of excitement--anything,\n",
      "anything, to relieve the monotony of this isolated bit of\n",
      "semi-civilization--where, I can tell you, more women meditate suicide\n",
      "from pure ennui than in any city on earth!\"\n",
      "Isabel was appalled by this outburst. The brilliant day seemed faded,\n",
      "the bright faces were grinning masks. Then she experienced a powerful\n",
      "rush of loyalty towards this stranded member of her own class, and\n",
      "before she realized what she was saying, she had offered to send her to\n",
      "Europe to finish the musical education begun in her promising youth.\n",
      "\"Don't be angry,\" she stammered, knowing the intense pride of the\n",
      "impoverished American. \"Why not? We are really related. I am quite\n",
      "alone. My little fortune has almost doubled. I make much more than I can\n",
      "spend. It would be quite shocking if I did not do something for some\n",
      "one--there is Paula of course, but it is against my principle to do too\n",
      "much for any woman with a husband. Do--please--\"\n",
      "Miss Montgomery, who had flushed deeply and averted her head, turned\n",
      "suddenly with a smile and a light in her eyes that, with the color in\n",
      "her cheeks, made her look young for a moment.\n",
      "\"That was just like you!\" she exclaimed. \"I remember in Rosewater, when\n",
      "you were a little thing, you used to give away the clothes on your back,\n",
      "and your toys never lasted a week; although you beat the children and\n",
      "pulled them about by the hair when they didn't play to suit you. I saw\n",
      "you on the street just after your return from Europe--you looked as if\n",
      "you had wrapped yourself up in the pride of your nature--had found a\n",
      "plane apart from common mortals. For that reason I did not remind you of\n",
      "my existence. But I should have remembered that you had had trouble and\n",
      "care enough to freeze any woman of your inheritances into a sort of\n",

      "makes me feel young again.\"\n",
      "\"And you will go?\" asked Isabel, eagerly.\n",

      "I am thirty-five. If you have made no place for yourself by that time in\n",
      "America you belong by a sort of divine decree to the treadmill. And the\n",
      "limberness has gone out of my fingers as out of my mind. Sometimes I\n",
      "deluge my pillow; but I will confess to you that down deep there is a\n",
      "consciousness of bluntness, and it makes me inconsistently satisfied to\n",
      "be here in this land of climate and plenty, instead of in Boston or New\n",
      "York, where both climatic and social conditions are so terribly stern\n",
      "for the poor. After all, the word 'struggle' is a mere euphemism out\n",
      "here, and I am still asked to nearly all of the big parties; not one of\n",
      "the older set has dropped me, and I could go out constantly if I chose.\n",
      "But I have neither the energy nor the money. I could have presents of\n",
      "ball gowns, but of course I won't accept them.\" She laid her hand on\n",
      "Isabel's. \"Don't imagine that I do not appreciate your generosity. I\n",
      "shall never forget it--nor the dear childish awkward spontaneity of its\n",
      "expression. But here I stay and rot.\"\n",
      "\"I heard this same lament from Lyster the other night; only he was more\n",
      "cheerful about it--possibly because he has other surcease--\"\n",
      "\"Don't waste any sympathy on us,\" said Miss Montgomery, contemptuously.\n",
      "\"There never was such a sieve as California--San Francisco--for\n",
      "separating the wheat from the chaff--for determining the survival of the\n",
      "fittest. If I had been worth my salt I should have conquered every\n",
      "obstacle, overcome the family will, when I was young and full of hope\n",
      "and vigor. So would Lyster Stone. San Francisco is stronger than we are.\n",
      "That is the truth in a nutshell. Those that are stronger than she have\n",
      "gone. The rest don't matter. And as so many of those that are really\n",
      "gifted enjoy themselves with only an occasional spasm of self-disgust,\n",
      "they are not greatly to be pitied. By and by they will outgrow even\n",
      "that, and congratulate themselves that they were not of those that fled\n",
      "from the good things of life.\"\n",
      "Mrs. Hofer ran down the steps and into her automobile. \"I\n",
      "simply--couldn't--get--away,\" she cried between the agonized thumpings\n",
      "of the engine. \"But perhaps you were glad to be rid of me a bit. Please\n",
      "don't say so, though. It would make me simply miserable.\"\n",
      "As the car glided off, she sat on the edge of the seat facing her\n",
      "guests, lightly, and with the same backward sweep of her body as when\n",
      "walking. She always seemed to be fairly bursting with youthful energy,\n",
      "and no bird could rival her buoyancy. She immediately assumed the burden\n",
      "of the conversation.\n",
      "\"Dear Miss Otis! I have been meaning all day to ask you about Lady\n",
      "Victoria Gwynne, but so many things have put it out of my head. What do\n",
      "you think of her? I am simply mad to know. I never met any one who\n",
      "interested me half so much; I couldn't make her out the least little\n",
      "bit. The only time when she seemed quite alive was when she spoke of\n",
      "her Jack. In the famous Elton she didn't seem to take any interest at\n",
      "all. I fancy they've fallen out, for whenever his name was\n",
      "mentioned--and Mr. Hofer admires him immensely--she always became as\n",
      "mute as a mummy. It put me out a bit. I'm not used to that sort of\n",
      "treatment. When I want to talk about a subject, I am in the habit of\n",
      "doing so. Lady Victoria is not a bit simple like so many English great\n",
      "ladies. Perhaps it's the Spanish blood, or perhaps it's because she's so\n",
      "_blasee_. They _do_ tell stories! I never heard any received woman\n",
      "accused of having had quite so many--well, at least in this town, when a\n",
      "woman is openly larky she soon finds herself on the north side of the\n",
      "fence. There was my Lady Victoria hobnobbing with all the royalties at\n",
      "Homburg. But what interested me most was her attitude to Sir Cadge\n",
      "Vanneck--\"\n",
      "\"What?\" Isabel sat erect. \"Has Sir Cadge Vanneck returned from Africa? I\n",
      "thought something besides ill health was detaining her. Do you think\n",
      "they will marry? I don't know whether Mr. Gwynne would like it or not.\n",
      "He looks forward to her arrival--\"\n",
      "\"I can see Lady Victoria on a California ranch! She would yawn her head\n",
      "off. London is 'the world' in quotation marks. She couldn't, that\n",
      "seasoned lady, stay out of it six months. But about Sir Cadge--that was\n",
      "the final mystery. It actually kept me awake one night. You know the\n",
      "story, how devoted he was for about two years, and then how he ran away\n",
      "when her husband was killed, for fear he would have to marry her. Nobody\n",
      "knew exactly how she felt about it, for one thing must be said for the\n",
      "people of those effete old civilizations: their breeding carries them\n",
      "through any crisis without the turn of a hair. But the report was that\n",
      "she showed an inner convulsion in subtle outer vibrations, or people\n",
      "imagined she did, probably because she'd got to that age where she\n",
      "couldn't have many illusions left. Then, suddenly, this summer, he\n",
      "returns, and follows her to Homburg. He is all devotion. She is an\n",
      "iceberg. And she's gone off dreadfully. I saw her seven years ago at\n",
      "Covent Garden, and she was the handsomest thing I ever looked at. She's\n",
      "handsome yet, but her muscles are getting that loose look and her eyes\n",
      "are bottomless pits of ennui. Save me from being a fashionable\n",
      "demimondaine. Better go to the deuce and die in a garret. Something\n",
      "honest in that, anyhow--and more picturesque. There may be something\n",
      "behind, that we don't know anything about, but in my opinion she is not\n",
      "the happiest of women; and with such a handsome and agreeable man as Sir\n",
      "Cadge Vanneck at her feet, she is just an ingrate. We are not here,\n",
      "already? I wish I were not invited this evening, I'd simply _make_ you\n",
      "come home to dinner. And it seems so rude to leave you at the foot of\n",
      "this bluff; but there is just one thing the automobile can't do--\"\n",
      "Isabel, her head spinning with many words, had been glad to express her\n",
      "pleasure in the day's entertainment and run up the steps to her refuge\n",
      "on the heights. She had found that Mr. Stone was still in bed and likely\n",
      "to remain there, and a haughty note from Paula announcing that she had\n",
      "returned to her children and should remain where she was wanted.\n",
      "She was vaguely planning to \"do something\" for Anne Montgomery, and\n",
      "congratulating herself that she could fly at will from people that\n",
      "talked too much, when she heard Gwynne's long stride on the plank walk,\n",
      "and called gayly to him out of the darkness \"to stand and deliver.\"\n",
      "\"I hope you carry a pistol,\" she added, anxiously, as he ran up the\n",
      "steps. \"I scarcely ever pick up a newspaper without reading of a\n",
      "hold-up, and there were four on this hill last week. We change, out\n",
      "here, but we don't seem to improve much.\"\n",
      "XXIV\n",
      "\"I have had what is called a full day,\" said Gwynne, as he sank into a\n",
      "chair beside Isabel. \"Lunch with half a dozen of the cleverest and most\n",
      "strenuous men I ever met--and not at Hofer's house, by the way, but out\n",
      "at the Cliff House, up in a tower, where we had a superb view of the\n",
      "ocean and Golden Gate; then motored about the city for three hours, then\n",
      "down to Burlingame for dinner, then back to supper at one of the\n",
      "restaurants. After over a year of social suspension I hardly knew how to\n",
      "behave, especially to all the pretty women I met at the Club House at\n",
      "Burlingame,--who seemed to expect me to pay them compliments and flirt\n",
      "desperately. I feel worn out, and on the verge of sighing for my lonely\n",
      "ranch.\"\n",
      "\"But you have enjoyed yourself,\" said Isabel, smiling. \"It has done you\n",
      "a lot of good. You must grow straight downward to your roots. Then, when\n",
      "you shoot up again you will be a real American.\"\n",
      "Gwynne made a wry face. \"Not yet. Mrs. Hofer's father, Mr. Toole (who is\n",
      "now retired and spends most of his time in about the most luxurious\n",
      "library I ever saw--we alighted in it for a few moments before swooping\n",
      "down to Burlingame) quoted Byron to me and is well up in English\n",
      "politics. There were several London newspapers and reviews on the table.\n",
      "Moreover, at the luncheon, Elton Gwynne was actually discussed for a\n",
      "few moments. All of which gave me pangs of homesickness. But although\n",
      "they are all sufficiently versed in British politics, their interest is\n",
      "very casual. Even national matters don't concern them particularly. What\n",
      "absorbs them is the redemption of San Francisco; and after my\n",
      "experiences last night I can't say I am surprised. The sort of municipal\n",
      "government that permits and battens upon an unlimited variety of open\n",
      "vice must devour the entire city in time. Mr. Toole informed me, in the\n",
      "holy calm of his library, that reform is impossible; and certainly the\n",
      "professional grafters seem to be one of the few productions of this\n",
      "State whose energy is not demoralized by the climate. But that must make\n",
      "the fight more interesting. And hardly a degree less menacing is this\n",
      "gigantic octapus of labor unionism--of inexcusable socialism. Well, we\n",
      "shall see! It makes one tingle.\"\n",
      "\"And do you never, in your inmost, contemplate returning to England?\"\n",
      "asked Isabel, curiously.\n",
      "Gwynne swung about and planted his elbows on the railing, clasping his\n",
      "hands about his head. For some moments he seemed absorbed in the mass of\n",
      "lights at the foot of the black hill-side. \"I don't know,\" he said,\n",
      "finally. \"It is possible that only my will keeps me from thinking about\n",
      "it. It may be that, having made up my mind before leaving England, I\n",
      "accomplished a final wrench and adjustment. I abstain from too much\n",
      "self-analysis; but it is certain that down deep I often feel a tug at\n",
      "familiar strings. I don't pretend to know myself, for after all what is\n",
      "each one of us but the composite of the race, always at war with a spark\n",
      "of individuality. Some fine morning I may wake up, order my trunk to be\n",
      "packed, and take the first train out of California.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, might you?\"\n",
      "\"Well, of course, I should stop and say good-bye to you. That is if I\n",
      "did not fall into a panic at the thought of a final encounter with that\n",
      "terrible will of yours.\" He turned and met a pair of eyes that were\n",
      "shining like a cat's in the dark. \"You know that you have been\n",
      "manipulating the strings of my destiny!\" he said, abruptly, and\n",
      "surprised at himself. \"I grew fearful of self-analysis and buried myself\n",
      "in the law--jolly good antidote--but I am always conscious of a subtle\n",
      "pressure on my will--was. I have thrown it off. It was either that or\n",
      "leave.\"\n",
      "\"Perhaps you have felt freer since Saturday morning,\" said Isabel,\n",
      "cruelly.\n",
      "His own eyes glittered, but if he blushed the darkness screened him.\n",
      "\"Quite true,\" he said, dryly, \"The man-brute turned. And in the final\n",
      "battle, when the feminine principle is pitted against the masculine, I\n",
      "fancy we shall know how to win the day. If we resort to primitive\n",
      "methods it will be your own fault.\"\n",
      "\"I was invited for dinner to-morrow night, and had to decline because my\n",
      "arms are black-and-blue.\"\n",
      "\"I don't repent,\" said Gwynne, doggedly.\n",
      "There was another silence, and then he asked: \"Haven't you been trying\n",
      "to manage me?\"\n",
      "\"I have only been trying to steer you in a new country--to make things a\n",
      "little easier--\"\n",
      "\"You are not always frank. And that is not altogether what I mean. I\n",
      "hardly know myself what I do mean. Before I arrived I thought it likely\n",
      "I should ma--want to marry you. In many respects you were designed to be\n",
      "the wife of an ambitious public man. With your beauty, and brains, your\n",
      "grand manner, and your subtlety--but it is the last that has put me\n",
      "off. I have seen too many men managed by their wives. I never could\n",
      "stand it. Doubtless my Celtic blood gives me the tiniest feminine drop.\n",
      "It is only the big uncomplicated oafs that don't mind being managed by\n",
      "their women. I should want the freest and most open companionship, but\n",
      "with my will always in the ascendant--although no man would be more\n",
      "indulgent to his wife.\"\n",
      "\"You will find thousands to answer all your requirements and\n",
      "limitations.\"\n",
      "\"Much you know about it. True, this place is full of handsome and\n",
      "attractive women--topping! And they have a free wild grace, a stride, a\n",
      "swing--it is wonderful to watch them go up these hills. And I was vastly\n",
      "entertained at luncheon, and at one or two of the houses where I was\n",
      "afterward taken to call. But I doubt if I shall ever find anyone again\n",
      "that possesses so many remarkable qualities in combination as your own\n",
      "puzzling unsatisfactory self.\"\n",
      "\"I am not in the least like Mrs. Kaye, and you thought she combined\n",
      "every quality under the sun.\"\n",
      "\"I expended the last of my calf love on Mrs. Kaye. I was blinded by\n",
      "passion; but that my emotional depths were not even stirred was\n",
      "manifested by the rapidity of my convalescence. We were utterly\n",
      "unsuited. In many respects I should have been ashamed of her. Blood must\n",
      "always tell in England--although in America--if Mrs. Hofer is a\n",
      "type--well, this is the land of reversed theories. Mrs. Kaye and I would\n",
      "have been at swords' points in less than a year. The next time I choose\n",
      "a wife it will be with my judgment.\"\n",
      "\"And are you no longer capable of love?\"\n",
      "\"Oh, love!\" Once more Gwynne gazed down upon the sleepless city, where\n",
      "the lights seemed to powder the upper air with gold dust. \"Perhaps. It\n",
      "seemed to me that day in Park Lane that all the heat died out of my\n",
      "veins. I am only just beginning to feel alive once more. But I have no\n",
      "wish as yet to experience the passion of love again--not even with you;\n",
      "although if you would cry off in some respects I don't know but that I\n",
      "should still like to marry you.\"\n",
      "\"At least you could beat me if I did not behave.\"\n",
      "He laughed. \"I don't doubt I should want to. No, I'll never let myself\n",
      "go like that again; but I should be sure first that my will was the\n",
      "stronger of the two.\"\n",
      "\"You carefully abstain from proposing so that I cannot make the retort I\n",
      "should like to.\"\n",
      "\"You may. I know you won't have me. But that does not alter the fact\n",
      "that the same ancestral lines have given us an inconceivable number of\n",
      "molecules that are subtly responsive. The great cleavage has\n",
      "accomplished as many points of divergence and contrast. Therefore is\n",
      "there, in me, at least, an insistent whisper for ancestral and long\n",
      "denied rights. You will feel it in time--\"\n",
      "\"How much you have thought about it!\"\n",
      "\"My mind is pretty well oiled: it does not take me years to work out any\n",
      "proposition. To tell you the truth, I have never put that undercurrent\n",
      "of consciousness into words until to-night. All the same, even if I\n",
      "loved you, if I finally believed you to be the stronger of the two, I\n",
      "should take the next boat for England. California wouldn't hold me. And\n",
      "I should not say good-bye.\"\n",
      "\"That would be a confession of weakness.\"\n",
      "\"It is one I'd be the better for making.\"\n",
      "\"Well, anyhow, as I am hostess I can order you to bed. It must be one\n",
      "o'clock. I don't doubt you will find more than one affinity if you are\n",
      "awakening; that is merely the mating instinct. Good-night.\"\n",
      "Far too hospitable and high-handed to incommode a guest, she did not\n",
      "tell him that Paula had gone, and that Stone had sauntered out in search\n",
      "of a \"bracer,\" and had not returned. Gwynne slept the sleep of the\n",
      "unburdened conscience, and returned to Rosewater by the first\n",
      "train--Isabel was remaining in town for another day--ignorant not only\n",
      "of having violated the proprieties, but of the fact that a former\n",
      "inhabitant of Rosewater lived not far from the foot of the bluff.\n",
      "XXV\n",
      "Two weeks later Lady Victoria was established in the house on Russian\n",
      "Hill. She had given no intimation of her coming until the day her train\n",
      "was due in Oakland, when she telegraphed, suddenly reflecting, no doubt,\n",
      "that she was descending into the wilderness and that precautions were\n",
      "wise. Gwynne barely had time to catch the train from Rosewater, and when\n",
      "the connecting boat arrived at the ferry building in San Francisco, he\n",
      "was obliged to run like a thief pursued by a policeman down to the\n",
      "Oakland ferry building, in order to catch the boat just starting to meet\n",
      "the Overland train. All this was by no means to his taste. Nor was his\n",
      "mother's cavalier arrival. It savored too much of royalty. And he had a\n",
      "masculine disapproval of being taken by surprise; moreover was far less\n",
      "ardent at the prospect of seeing his mother again than he would have\n",
      "expected. In England he had needed her; she seemed superfluous in this\n",
      "country, which she never would understand; and he wanted all his time\n",
      "for his studies--and as little reminder of England as possible. His\n",
      "mother, for all her individualities, was the concentrated essence of the\n",
      "England he knew best. Besides, she was accustomed to a great deal of\n",
      "attention. He had no taste for dancing attendance upon any one, and from\n",
      "whom else could she expect it--unless, to be sure--he recalled that his\n",
      "mother was a beautiful woman, always surrounded by a court of admirers.\n",
      "Why should Americans be impervious to the accomplished fascination and\n",
      "the beauty of a woman that had reigned in London for thirty years? He\n",
      "determined to press Isabel into service. She could try her hand on his\n",
      "mother's American destinies, and provide her with amusement and a host\n",
      "of friends.\n",
      "He felt all the promptings of natural affection when he was actually\n",
      "face to face with his mother once more, and forgot all his doubts in his\n",
      "intense amusement at her naive surprise before the comfortable immensity\n",
      "of the San Francisco hotels, and the crowds and automobiles in the\n",
      "streets.\n",
      "The next day he took her up to the ranch. For a week she stalked about\n",
      "the country, eight hours out of the twenty-four, expressing interest in\n",
      "nothing, although her eyes always softened at her son's approach; and if\n",
      "she manifested no enthusiasm for his adopted country, at least she\n",
      "barely mentioned the one of his heart. At the end of a week she promptly\n",
      "accepted Isabel's suggestion to transfer herself and her grim disgusted\n",
      "maid to the house on Russian Hill. Isabel lost no time in piloting her\n",
      "thither. Anne Montgomery undertook to provide her with a small staff of\n",
      "servants, and to call daily and order the household until all wheels\n",
      "were on their tracks. Mrs. Hofer delightedly agreed to be the social\n",
      "sponsor of Lady Victoria Gwynne, and issued invitations at once for a\n",
      "tea and a dinner; and Gwynne, who had been half indifferent to\n",
      "rebuilding on the San Francisco property, immediately began holding long\n",
      "interviews with bankers, lawyers, architects, and contractors. The law\n",
      "required him to give but thirty days' notice to his tenants, well-to-do\n",
      "workmen; and if all went well the building might be finished in seven\n",
      "months. Lady Victoria evinced something like a renewed interest in life\n",
      "when told that by the following winter her income would be increased;\n",
      "and trebled as soon as the large revenue from the building had paid off\n",
      "the mortgage. Her son offered to place his own share at her disposal\n",
      "until her debts were paid, but to this she would not listen. He found\n",
      "her maternal affection undimmed, but other changes in her which he was\n",
      "far too masculine to understand, and after she was fairly settled and\n",
      "apparently content, he dismissed feminine idiosyncrasies from his\n",
      "overburdened mind. He had neglected his studies long enough, and it was\n",
      "time to begin his amateur practice in Judge Leslie's office, to say\n",
      "nothing of the bi-weekly lecture at the State University at Berkeley,\n",
      "which, with the journeys, consumed the day.\n",
      "Isabel's feminine soul took a far more abiding interest in the subtle\n",
      "changes of that complicated modern evolution whose special arrangement\n",
      "of particles was labelled Victoria Gwynne. She bore little external\n",
      "traces of her illness, and when Isabel congratulated her upon so\n",
      "complete a recovery, she looked as blank as if memory had failed her.\n",
      "Isabel had encountered this truly British attitude before, and\n",
      "experienced none of the irritation of several of the Englishwoman's new\n",
      "acquaintances when insisting upon the beneficence of the San Francisco\n",
      "climate. But it was not long before Isabel discerned that under that\n",
      "sphinx-like exterior the older woman was intensely nervous, that once or\n",
      "twice even her splendid breeding could not control an outburst of\n",
      "irritability. Her eyes, too, had a curious hard opaque look, as if the\n",
      "old voluptuous fires had burned out; and she seemed ever on her guard.\n",
      "What her future plans were no man could guess. She might have settled\n",
      "down for life on Russian Hill, so completely did she make the new\n",
      "environment fit her imperious person. She even remarked casually to\n",
      "Isabel that \"of course\" she should entertain in the course of the\n",
      "winter, but at one of the hotels; she would never ask people to climb\n",
      "those stairs on a possibly rainy night. But it was evident that her\n",
      "entertaining would be merely on the principle of noblesse oblige; her\n",
      "lack of interest in the doings of a civilization so different from her\n",
      "own was patent, and it was doubtful if she would have even accepted the\n",
      "attentions showered upon her had she not feared the alternative of an\n",
      "unbroken ennui. Isabel felt vaguely sorry for her, and puzzled deeply,\n",
      "but she could do no more than provide her with entertainment and the\n",
      "abundant comforts and luxuries of the city; to express any deeper and\n",
      "more womanly sympathy to that proud nature would have been a liberty\n",
      "Isabel would have been the last to take. But she retained her own rooms\n",
      "and went down with Gwynne once a week, when they both devoted themselves\n",
      "to Lady Victoria's amusement. It was at least gratifying that the French\n",
      "restaurants and many of the unique Bohemian resorts entertained her more\n",
      "than society; and she found the Stones amusing, and frankly made use of\n",
      "Paula, who did all her shopping, receiving many a careless present.\n",
      "Meanwhile Gwynne, when not reading, or practising, or attending\n",
      "lectures, or endeavoring to hurry forward his new enterprise in the\n",
      "city, took long buggy rides with Tom Colton about the country, and made\n",
      "acquaintance with many farmers, as well as with the guileful depths of\n",
      "the ambitious young politician. Colton, although for the present\n",
      "dependent upon only the voters of his district, by no means confined\n",
      "his attentions even to those of his county. The time would come when he\n",
      "would need a wide popularity, and with his cool far-sighted tactics he\n",
      "was already sowing its seeds. There was an immense and varied material\n",
      "to work on. Not only were his own county and the two adjoining as large\n",
      "as a State more modest than California, but, with the exception of the\n",
      "Asti vineyards, and one or two ranches like Lumalitas, were cut up into\n",
      "an infinite number of farms owned by Irish, Scotch, Danes, Norwegians,\n",
      "Swedes, Hungarians, Swiss, Germans, Italians, and a few native\n",
      "Americans. Asti alone, a great district devoted to the vine, and\n",
      "boasting the largest tank in the world, was entirely in the hands of\n",
      "Italians. The Swiss, for the most part, were cheese makers. The rest\n",
      "devoted themselves to chickens, grain, hay, wheat, and fruit. There were\n",
      "several orange orchards and one violet farm. Many of these foreigners\n",
      "were so numerous that churches had been built for their separate use,\n",
      "and service was held in their native tongue. All were willing to drop\n",
      "work for a few moments and talk politics with Colton, particularly if it\n",
      "was to abuse lawmakers and monopolists--above all, the railroads, whose\n",
      "prices were exorbitant, and whose service was inadequate. In this\n",
      "department of monopoly at least they had a real grievance, and Colton\n",
      "never let them forget it. He made no secret of the fact that the United\n",
      "States Senate was his goal, and reiterated that there alone could he\n",
      "accomplish the legislation that would free the farmer from the costly\n",
      "tyranny of the corporations and give the laboring man his rightful share\n",
      "of profit. Some were skeptical that any mortal could accomplish all he\n",
      "promised, but the foreigners for the most part were gullible, and they\n",
      "all liked the rich man's son, with his simple ways and his blatant\n",
      "democracy.\n",
      "Of Gwynne they took little notice, but he studied them, one and all, and\n",
      "it was not long before he understood the materials with which he must\n",
      "deal in the future. The State was Republican, although San Francisco\n",
      "presented the remarkable spectacle of a Democratic mayor with a\n",
      "Republican boss controlling the labor element, which was presumably\n",
      "democratic in essence, and devoted to the figurehead. But country\n",
      "politics were far less complicated, and it was possible that a strong\n",
      "Democrat with a sufficiency of inherent power could weld together the\n",
      "conflicting and half indifferent elements, and change the political\n",
      "current. Californians had gone thunderously Republican at the last\n",
      "Presidential election, because for the moment they were dazzled by the\n",
      "Roosevelt star and all it seemed to portend. There could be no better\n",
      "augury for a really great and sincere leader; for whether or not\n",
      "Roosevelt was all they imagined, the point to consider was that they had\n",
      "been carried away by their higher enthusiasms, not by those a mere\n",
      "trickster like Colton was trying to stimulate. They had rushed to the\n",
      "polls with all that was best in their natures in the ascendant, eager\n",
      "not only for a great servant that would reform many abuses, but for one\n",
      "that stood at the moment before the country as the embodiment of all\n",
      "that was high-minded, uncompromisingly honest, and nobly patriotic in\n",
      "American life. It was one of the greatest personal triumphs ever\n",
      "accomplished--for the leaders wished nothing more ardently than his\n",
      "downfall--and whether or not it was to be justified by history, it must\n",
      "ever remain to his credit that he had hypnotized his countrymen through\n",
      "the higher channels of their nature. The reaction might be bitter, but\n",
      "memory is short, and at least he had served to demonstrate that the\n",
      "American mind was not materialized by the lust of gain, was quite as\n",
      "susceptible to the loftier patriotic promptings as in the days of its\n",
      "revolutionary and simpler ancestors. A man like Colton might delude for\n",
      "a time, for the Democratic party was deplorably weak in leaders, and the\n",
      "Republican bosses, in California, as elsewhere, had made the State a\n",
      "byword for shameless corruption; and their iron heel ground hard even in\n",
      "that land of climate and plenty. Colton might be useful to rouse\n",
      "Californians to a sense of their wrongs and opportunities, but Gwynne\n",
      "doubted if he could hold them. He promised too much. The time would come\n",
      "when they would turn to a strong man who talked less and did more, who\n",
      "gradually imbued them with the conviction of absolute honesty,\n",
      "distinguished ability, and as much disinterestedness as it is reasonable\n",
      "to expect of any mortal striving for the great prizes of life.\n",
      "One day there was a mass-meeting suddenly called to express sympathy\n",
      "with the orange growers of the South, who had dumped twelve carloads of\n",
      "early oranges into the San Francisco Bay rather than submit to the\n",
      "increased rates of the transcontinental railroads. Gwynne saw his\n",
      "opportunity and summoned his powers. There was a moment of doubt, of\n",
      "hesitancy, of reflection that he was rusty, and that the subject was of\n",
      "no special interest to him; then, at the eager insistence of Colton, he\n",
      "walked rapidly to the front of the platform with all the actor's exalted\n",
      "nervous delight in a new role. In a few moments there was no subject on\n",
      "earth so interesting to him as the iniquities of the railroads and the\n",
      "wrongs of the orange growers; he awoke from his torpor so triumphantly\n",
      "that his amazed audience, as of old, felt the deep flattery of its\n",
      "power over him, and he made a speech which was like the rushing of risen\n",
      "waters through a broken dam. Not that he permitted himself to be carried\n",
      "away wholly; he deliberately refrained from indiscriminate phillipics,\n",
      "from rousing their ire too far, grasped the opportunity to see what\n",
      "could be done by appealing to their reason through their higher\n",
      "emotions, and begged them to meet constantly and consider the question\n",
      "of electing men that were not mere politicians, that would deliver the\n",
      "State from the medieval tyranny that oppressed it; advised his hearers\n",
      "to employ the best legal counsel they could get, and to give their\n",
      "leisure moments to the study of practical politics, instead of\n",
      "indolently submitting all great questions to the hands of men as\n",
      "unscrupulous as the State bosses and corporations. With his peculiar\n",
      "gift he made each breathless man in the auditorium feel not only that he\n",
      "was being personally addressed, but that his mental equipment had\n",
      "mysteriously been raised to the plane of the speaker's. When Gwynne\n",
      "finished amid applause as great as any he had evoked in England after\n",
      "the expounding of great issues dear to his heart, he turned to find\n",
      "Colton regarding him with sharp eyes and lowering brow. He immediately\n",
      "took his arm and led him without.\n",
      "\"I am glad a climax has come so soon,\" he said. \"Otherwise I should have\n",
      "begun to feel like a hypocrite. Not only are your principles and mine\n",
      "utterly antagonistic, but you must consider me as your rival. I can do\n",
      "nothing definite, of course, for nearly four years, and meanwhile you\n",
      "may reach the United States Senate. If you do I shall do my utmost to\n",
      "oust you. Nevertheless, if I can be of any service in sending you there\n",
      "I am perfectly willing to place myself at your disposal, for the\n",
      "experience and insight I shall acquire in exchange. And as you are no\n",
      "worse than the others, and some one must go, it might as well be you as\n",
      "another. But, I repeat, I shall use all my powers to oust you and take\n",
      "your place.\"\n",
      "Colton stood for a few moments, his hands in his pockets, regarding the\n",
      "ground. Then he lifted his eyes and smiled ingenuously.\n",
      "\"You are dead straight, for a fact. And I think I have got just as good\n",
      "an opinion of myself as you have of yourself. You put me in the United\n",
      "States Senate with that tongue of yours--God, you can talk!--and I'll\n",
      "take the chances of even you getting me out. It will take more than\n",
      "eloquence to upset a great State machine, and before I get through I'll\n",
      "have the Democratic machine stronger than the Republican is to-day. You\n",
      "can't get anywhere in this country without the machine, and the man in\n",
      "control stays in control unless he falls down, and this I don't propose\n",
      "to do. I'll swap frankness and tell you right here that when I'm boss I\n",
      "may let you come to Congress as my colleague, but that you've got to do\n",
      "as I say when you get there. What do you say to that?\"\n",
      "\"I'll take all the chances. At least we understand each other. I work\n",
      "for you now, and I break the power of both you and your infernal machine\n",
      "when I am a citizen of the United States.\"\n",
      "\"Shake,\" said Colton.\n",
      "And they shook.\n",
      "XXVI\n",
      "Isabel sat idly on the veranda of her old hotel as was her habit in the\n",
      "evening hour. There had been no heavy rains as yet to freshen the hills\n",
      "and swell the tides until the salt waters scalded the juices from the\n",
      "marsh grass, turning it from green to bronze and red; and the barometer\n",
      "was stationary. A cool wind came in from the sea with the flood, and\n",
      "Isabel enjoyed the beauty that was hers all the more luxuriously in her\n",
      "thick shawl of white wool. A great part of the valley north and south\n",
      "was within the range of her vision, and it was suffused with gold under\n",
      "a sky that looked like an inverted crucible pouring down its treasures\n",
      "in the prodigal fashion of the land. Facing her house and on the\n",
      "opposite side of the marsh, at its widest here, was a high wall of rock,\n",
      "from which the valley curved backward on either side, tapering to the\n",
      "great level in the north, but on the south halting abruptly before the\n",
      "mass of mountains following the coast line and topped by the angular\n",
      "shoulder of Tamalpais; coal black to-night against the intense gold of\n",
      "the West.\n",
      "She had not seen Gwynne for several days, and half expected that he\n",
      "would come to-night. These were busy days, and she saw less of him than\n",
      "formerly, although he snatched an hour for shooting whenever he could,\n",
      "and occasionally rode over for supper; and they saw much of each other\n",
      "during the weekly visit to the city. Their relations were easy and\n",
      "sexless. He refused to talk of chickens, but they had many other\n",
      "interests in common. She had by no means forgotten his outbreak in the\n",
      "launch, and had scowled at her arms for quite a week as she brushed her\n",
      "hair for bed, but that episode was now several weeks old, and she had\n",
      "ceased to harbor resentment. But she was subtly out of conceit with\n",
      "herself and life, resentful that she missed any one, after her long\n",
      "triumph in freedom from human ties; also resentful of the respect and\n",
      "interest with which Gwynne had inspired her, particularly since his\n",
      "summary expulsion of her will from the battle ground where it was\n",
      "becoming accustomed to easy triumphs. She had no love for him, and she\n",
      "was as satisfied with the life she had chosen as ever, but she was\n",
      "beginning to feel a sense of approaching confusion, where readjustment\n",
      "would once more be necessary. The future looked longer, and she was\n",
      "losing her pleasant sense of finality. She had guessed long ago that the\n",
      "only chance of escaping the terrible restlessness that pursues so many\n",
      "women, like enemies in the unseen world converted into furies, was to\n",
      "caress and hug the present, fool the ego into the belief that it wanted\n",
      "nothing beyond an imminent future, certain of realization, which should\n",
      "be as all-possessing as the present. But she had been wise enough to do\n",
      "little analysis, either of her depths or of life, and her time was full\n",
      "enough.\n",
      "\"Are you asleep?\" asked a polite voice. Gwynne swung himself over the\n",
      "low railing of the veranda.\n",
      "\"I did not hear your horse.\" It would be long before he could surprise\n",
      "her into any sort of emotion again.\n",
      "\"Good reason. I walked. I read Cooley until I had an alarming vision of\n",
      "the Constitution of the United States writ black upon the sunset, so I\n",
      "thought it was high time to walk it off. Naturally my footsteps led me\n",
      "here.\"\n",
      "\"That was nice of them. Mac will drive you home, or you can have my\n",
      "horse.\"\n",
      "\"It is like you to plan my departure before I have fairly arrived. May I\n",
      "sit down?\"\n",
      "Isabel shivered. The glow had gone, there was only the intense dark\n",
      "fiery blue behind the stars--silver and crystal and green; one rarely\n",
      "sees a golden star in California. There were scattered lights in\n",
      "Rosewater and on the hillsides; and the night boat winding through the\n",
      "marsh was a mere chain of colored lights; here and there a lamp on a\n",
      "head mast looked like a fallen star.\n",
      "\"That is the way I generally feel after the glow has disappeared,\" said\n",
      "Gwynne, abruptly. \"Let us go in.\"\n",
      "There were blazing logs on the hearth, and a comfortable chair on either\n",
      "side. The room looked very red and warm and seductive. As they passed\n",
      "the table Isabel half lifted one of the English Reviews for which she\n",
      "subscribed. \"There is an allusion to you here,\" she said. \"I meant to\n",
      "send it to you. I fancy they want you back. It is very complimentary.\"\n",
      "But Gwynne concealed the promptings of vanity and took one of the chairs\n",
      "at the fireside, asking permission to light his pipe. She noted, as she\n",
      "settled herself opposite, that there was less of repose in his long\n",
      "figure than formerly, something of repressed activity, and his rather\n",
      "heavy eyes were colder and more alert.\n",
      "\"It all seems a thousand years ago,\" he said. \"I am John Gwynne. I doubt\n",
      "if I shall ever love your California, but I am interested--this mass of\n",
      "typical Europeans not yet Americanized--no common brain to work on, no\n",
      "one set of racial peculiarities. And the law has me fast. I have become\n",
      "frightfully ambitious. Talk about your Hamilton. I too walk the floor\n",
      "till the small hours, repeating pages aloud. My Jap thinks me mad, and\n",
      "no doubt is only induced to remain at his post by the excellence of my\n",
      "tobacco, and the fact that his education is unhindered by much service.\n",
      "While I am packing my own brain cells I infer that he is attending a\n",
      "night school in St. Peter, for I hear him returning at all hours; and he\n",
      "certainly shows no trace of other dissipation. We have never exchanged\n",
      "ten sentences, but perhaps we act as a mutual stimulus.\"\n",
      "\"Don't you love California the least little bit?\" asked Isabel,\n",
      "wistfully. \"Or San Francisco?\"\n",
      "\"I have liked San Francisco too well upon several occasions--when I have\n",
      "run down to spend the night at the Hofers--or have fallen in with Stone\n",
      "on my way back from Berkeley, and been induced to stay over. Hofer and\n",
      "that set seem to be content with living well; they are too serious for\n",
      "dissipation. But Stone! Of course such men die young, but they are\n",
      "useful in exciting the mind to wonder and awe. I don't think I am in any\n",
      "danger of becoming San Franciscan to the point of feeding her insatiable\n",
      "furnaces with all the fires of my being, but there is no denying her\n",
      "fascination, and it has given me a very considerable pleasure to yield\n",
      "to it. Whether I shall practise law there--change my base--I have not\n",
      "yet had time to think it out.\"\n",
      "\"A country lawyer's is certainly no career.\"\n",
      "\"This is a good place to begin politically. San Francisco is too hard a\n",
      "nut to crack at present. If I could become powerful in the State, the\n",
      "Independent leader they need, then I might transfer my attentions to\n",
      "that unhappy town. Even Hofer and all the rest of the devoted band seem\n",
      "to be practically helpless since the re-election of the mayor. What\n",
      "could I do--at present?\"\n",
      "\"With a big legal reputation made in San Francisco you could travel very\n",
      "fast and far. And you would be learning every thread of every rope,\n",
      "become what is technically known as 'on'; and then when the time came--\"\n",
      "\"I hate so much waiting! The shortest cut is here in the country. I\n",
      "shall manage these men far better than Colton, who is the crudest type\n",
      "of American politician. Nothing could be simpler than his program:\n",
      "abuse, promise. Nothing simpler than his ambition: all for himself, and\n",
      "the devil take the hindmost. I have yet to hear him utter a sentiment\n",
      "that betrays any love of his country or desire to serve her, any real\n",
      "public spirit. Those are the sentiments I am trying to cultivate for\n",
      "this accidental land of my birth, for without them ambition is\n",
      "inexcusable and endeavor a hollow sham.\"\n",
      "\"And can't you?\" Isabel left her chair and stood by the mantel-piece. It\n",
      "was the first time he had spoken of himself with any approach to\n",
      "confidence since the day of his arrival. \"Sometimes I repent the share I\n",
      "had in your coming to America--not that I flatter myself I had much to\n",
      "do with it--\" she added, hastily. \"But my being there may have turned\n",
      "the scale. You might have gone off to rule a South American Republic--\"\n",
      "\"I should have done nothing so asinine, and you had everything to do\n",
      "with my coming here. Not that I hold you responsible. You gave a hint,\n",
      "and I took it.\"\n",
      "\"And you don't regret it?\"\n",
      "\"Why waste time in regret? I can go back any moment. Not that I have the\n",
      "least intention of doing anything of the sort.\"\n",
      "He was pleasantly tired in mind and body, and the warm homelike room\n",
      "caressed his senses. He settled himself more deeply in Hiram Otis's old\n",
      "chair and looked up at Isabel. She had laid aside the white shawl, but\n",
      "wore a red Indian scarf over her black gown. The gown was cut out in a\n",
      "square at the neck; she always dressed for her lonely supper, and she\n",
      "had put a red rose in her hair, in the fashion of her California\n",
      "grandmothers. With her face turned from the light, her eyes with their\n",
      "large pupils looked black.\n",
      "\"I shall stay in California, like or no like,\" continued Gwynne. \"But I\n",
      "did not walk five miles to talk politics with a woman after a day of law\n",
      "and the citizens of Rosewater. Where did you get that curious\n",
      "old-fashioned scarf?\"\n",
      "\"I found it in a trunk of my mother's. Doubtless it belonged to her\n",
      "mother. I also found this.\" She indicated a fine gold chain and heart of\n",
      "garnets that lay on her white neck. The humor in his eyes had quickened\n",
      "into admiration; he reflected that the various streams in her\n",
      "composition might not be so completely blended as would appear upon that\n",
      "normally placid surface. The feeling of uneasiness which he had\n",
      "peremptorily dismissed stole over him once more. She looked wholly\n",
      "Spanish, and put out the light of every brunette he knew. Dolly Boutts,\n",
      "whom he still admired at a distance, although he fled at her approach,\n",
      "was a bouncing peasant by contrast; and several well-bred and\n",
      "entertaining young women of the same warm hues that he had met during\n",
      "the past few weeks in San Francisco suddenly seemed to be the merest\n",
      "climatic accidents beside this girl who unrolled the pages of\n",
      "California's older past and afforded him a fleeting vision of those\n",
      "lovely donas and fiery caballeros for whom life was an eternal\n",
      "playground. That they were his progenitors as well as hers he found it\n",
      "difficult to realize, he seemed to have inherited so little of them; but\n",
      "they had flown generously to Isabel's making, and to-night she gave him\n",
      "that same impression of historic background as when she turned the\n",
      "severity of her profile up on him and suggested a doughtier race.\n",
      "\"It was about the same time,\" he said, abruptly.\n",
      "\"What?\"\n",
      "\"While our Spanish ancestors were playing at this end of the continent,\n",
      "our 'American' forefathers were bracing themselves against England. It\n",
      "was in 1776 that the Presidio and Mission of San Francisco were founded,\n",
      "was it not? Curious coincidence. Perhaps that is what gives you your\n",
      "sense of destiny.\"\n",
      "\"I have no sense of destiny.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, but you have. Now I know that you are quite Spanish to-night. It is\n",
      "your more ordinary mood of calm unvarnished--not to say\n",
      "brutal--directness that gives you your greatest charm as a comrade--even\n",
      "while you repel as a woman.\"\n",
      "\"Do I repel as a woman?\" Isabel had placed one foot on the fender, one\n",
      "hand on the mantel-piece, and as she leaned slightly towards him, the\n",
      "red glow of the lamps and the mellow old scarf softening her features,\n",
      "the small square of neck dazzlingly white, and the position revealing\n",
      "the lines of her figure against the high flames of the logs, she looked\n",
      "more lovely than he had ever seen her. Like all racial beauties, bred by\n",
      "selection, she needed the arts of dress and furnishings to frame her.\n",
      "It is only your accidental or peasant beauty that can defy \"clothes\";\n",
      "and Isabel's looks in ordinary ranch and riding costumes made no\n",
      "impression on Gwynne whatever. But to-night her appeal was very direct,\n",
      "although he had not the least idea whether she was posing or was\n",
      "entirely natural in an unusual mood. He had no intention of being made a\n",

      "and then perhaps you would fall in love with me merely because of my own\n",
      "lack of picturesqueness, and we should live happily ever after.\"\n",
      "\"What a bore.\" Isabel sniffed, and moved her gaze to the fire. But she\n",
      "did not alter her attitude.\n",
      "\"Are you really happy?\" asked Gwynne, curiously.\n",
      "\"Of course. So much so that it begins to worry me a little. My\n",
      "puritanical instincts dictate that I have no right to be quite happy.\n",
      "What slaves we are to the old poisons in our blood! I live by the light\n",
      "of my reason, and all is well until one of those mouldy instincts, like\n",
      "a buried disease germ, raps all round its tomb. Then I feel nothing but\n",
      "a graveyard of all my ancestors. I don't let them out, and my reason\n",
      "continues its rule, but they keep me from being--well--entirely happy,\n",
      "and I resent that.\"\n",
      "\"I should say it was not the Puritans but your common womanly instincts\n",
      "that were thumping round their cells. You have no right to be happy\n",
      "except as Nature intended when she deliberately equipped you, and that\n",
      "is in making some man happy.\"\n",
      "\"That is one of those superstitions I am trying to live down while I am\n",
      "still young. Your mother is unhappy, under all her pride, because she\n",
      "has outlived youth and beauty and all they meant to her--she made them\n",
      "her gods, and now they have gone, and she doesn't know which way to\n",
      "turn. Ennui devours her, and she is too old to turn her brains to\n",
      "account, too cynical for the average resource of religion, and too\n",
      "steeped, dyed, solidified, in one kind of womanism to turn at this late\n",
      "date to any other. But there are so many resources for the woman of\n",
      "to-day. The poor despised pioneers have done that for us. Of course it\n",
      "has not killed our natural instincts, and if I had not fallen in love\n",
      "when I did, no doubt I should still be looking about for an opportunity.\n",
      "It is my good-fortune that I was delivered so soon. I wish all women\n",
      "born to enjoy life in its variety could be freed of that terrible burden\n",
      "of sex as early as I was.\"\n",
      "\"I suppose you would like to rid men of it too.\"\n",
      "\"I do not waste any thought on men; so far as I have observed they are\n",

      "\"A woman incapable of passion is neither more nor less than a failure.\"\n",
      "\"I have seen so many commonplace women capable of it! Look at Mrs.\n",
      "Haight and Paula.\"\n",
      "\"I never look at Mrs. Haight, but as for Mrs. Stone I can quite conceive\n",
      "that if she had better taste she would be almost charming. She embodies\n",
      "youth properly equipped.\"\n",
      "\"For reproduction, you mean. That is the reason that the silliest, the\n",
      "meanest, the most poisonous girl can always find a husband if she is\n",
      "healthy. It is no wonder that some of us want a new standard.\"\n",
      "Gwynne laughed. \"Schopenhauer suits you better when you are out on the\n",

      "picturesque successor of measles and whooping-cough. In marriage it may\n",
      "develop into something worth while, but in itself amounts to\n",
      "nothing--except as material for poets. But the real drama--that is in\n",
      "the permanent relation. This relation is the motive power of the great\n",
      "known dramas of the world. Life is packed with little unheard of dramas\n",
      "of precisely the same sort--the eternal duet of sex; nothing else keeps\n",

      "\"I don't say that,\" he replied, in a moment. \"I believe I intimated that\n",
      "I came here to-night with a purpose. It was to tell you that I have\n",
      "thought more or less about what you said in the boat that morning, and\n",
      "that I can understand, if I cannot agree with you. No doubt the times\n",
      "have bred a certain class of women too good for mere matrimony. I have\n",
      "seen many that were miserably thrown away; although I will confess that\n",
      "the only remedy that occurred to me was a better man. But if you and\n",
      "your like--are there really any others?--if you, let us say, are groping\n",
      "towards some new solution of life, some happiness recipe that will\n",
      "benefit the few that deserve it, far be it from a mere man\n",
      "to--well--pinch you. You--you individually--have so many highly\n",
      "developed faculties that I can conceive your finding sufficient\n",
      "occupation through them, a filling up of time;--and no doubt idleness\n",
      "and the vain groping after sex happiness are the principal reasons for\n",
      "the failure of so many women. But work does not give happiness; it\n",
      "merely diminishes the capacity and opportunities for unhappiness. I take\n",
      "it that you, with all your gifts and the immense amount of thought you\n",
      "have bestowed on the subject, are striving for something higher than\n",
      "that. Besides, I had your lucid exposition of your mission. I now have\n",
      "an additional reason for remaining in California--to watch the new\n",
      "century plant flower. Like other commonplace mortals, however, my\n",
      "instincts fight for the only solution of happiness I know anything\n",
      "about. I still think that as the wife of some ambitious public man you\n",
      "would find a far better market for your gifts than to stand as a sort of\n",

      "\"Even a sneer cannot spoil your loveliness to-night, so I don't mind the\n",

      "\"I am not so sure of that, if both were working to the same end. It\n",
      "takes two halves to make a whole. If women have so far been the\n",
      "subordinate sex, no doubt it is merely the result of those physical\n",
      "disabilities which enabled man to gain the ascendency during the long\n",
      "centuries of struggle with nature. But your sex is rapidly altering all\n",

      "have never been opposed to it--and that is proof enough of the progress\n",
      "the idea has made, for I am arbitrary and masculine enough. Then--now,\n",
      "no doubt--women will be as much partners as wives, and I grant the\n",
      "relationship might be vastly more interesting than marriage in the old\n",
      "style. And I will even concede that it may be the only sort of marriage\n",
      "for a man of my type--with a pretty woman, of course; hanged if I could\n",
      "marry the finest woman in the world if she were ugly; and if this be\n",
      "true--if men really need women enough to make such a concession as I am\n",
      "making this moment, then I fancy that women will retain enough of their\n",

      "to take her place; you actually stirred my maternal instincts when you\n",
      "arrived, you looked so forlorn. But you spurned me, and now you have\n",
      "grown too independent even to illustrate your own theories.\"\n",
      "\"I did not spurn you. Some day I may tell you why I did not come to you\n",

      "To this Isabel deigned no reply, and a silence ensued. She transferred\n",
      "her gaze to the fire, and her mind revolved in search of new arguments,\n",
      "but it was tired and worked slowly. She concluded to change the subject\n",
      "and offer to read him the article in the Review, so complimentary to\n",
      "himself; but she turned her head to discover that he was sound asleep.\n",
      "She laughed, half vexed, half amused. Then she laid a rug lightly over\n",
      "his knees, and softly replenished the fire. The room was deliciously\n",
      "warm, her own chair very comfortable. She too fell asleep.\n",
      "She was rudely awakened. Gwynne was shaking her by the shoulder, and his\n",
      "face was white with consternation.\n",

      "critical eye upon the silver spoon standing in lonely glory on the\n",

      "was far too cunning to detain them from the tables they fairly rushed at\n",
      "as the last member arrived, and it was not until they had \"scrapped\" and\n",

      "and evil-scenting profile, was really a woman of high ideals. Her\n",
      "severity to others was due to the secret knowledge that these ideals\n",
      "were beyond her personal accomplishment, and the satisfaction to be\n",
      "derived from audibly rating the failings of her neighbors. Her highest\n",
      "ideal was self-control, particularly in relation to the weaknesses of\n",
      "the flesh; but after a period of stern abstinence, she indulged\n",
      "inordinately in oysters, fried chicken with cream gravy, and ice-cream\n",
      "with cocoanut cake; and sipped a night-cap upon retiring. Her passion\n",
      "for cards had long since routed her will; but she intended to reform\n",
      "wholly in time, for she walked in fear of the Lord. If she judged the\n",
      "young harshly, she persuaded herself that she had only their well-being\n",
      "at heart. She was one of the pillars of the church and gave liberally to\n",
      "its support.\n",
      "Mrs. Haight, who, as we have seen, enjoyed one of those purely\n",
      "fortuitous reputations for cleverness, was Secretary of the combined\n",
      "wings of the Club, and sat on Mrs. Leslie's left. Mrs. Wheaton's portly\n",
      "person was sheathed in purple velvet, and there were handsome strings\n",
      "between two of her chins, but Mrs. Haight wore a battered hat of\n",
      "Neapolitan straw bedecked with a ragged bunch of carnations. It sat on\n",
      "one side of her ill-kept head, giving her a singularly rakish and\n",
      "definite appearance. She was furthermore attired in an old Paisley shawl\n",
      "belonging to her grandmother--what better way to advertise a\n",
      "grandmother?--over a blue alpaca frock made by her own unskilful\n",
      "fingers. Mr. Haight was the most prosperous druggist in Rosewater, but\n",
      "his wife had sounding virtues.\n",
      "The other members of the Club, some sixty in number, were as variously\n",
      "dressed as became their pockets or proclivities, decently for the most\n",
      "part, for there was no poverty in Rosewater. Mrs. Leslie took no notice\n",
      "of the charged atmosphere, but proceeded to business as methodically as\n",
      "if engaged in her morning housekeeping. The minutes of the last meeting\n",
      "were read by Mrs. Haight, in the cultivated tones of one who had recited\n",
      "upon the stage of her youth, \"Curfew shall not ring to-night,\" and \"The\n",
      "Wreck of the Hesperus.\" The huskily strident voice trembled slightly,\n",
      "but she read several pages of foolscap without a break, and finished\n",
      "with a flourish. Then Mrs. Leslie, in spite of scraping chairs, asked\n",
      "Mrs. Colton, Chairman of the Improvement Inspection Committee to read\n",
      "her report on the condition of the new concrete pavements, of several\n",
      "homesick palm-trees in the public squares, and on the prospect of\n",
      "removing tin cans and soda-water bottles from the picnic grounds. This\n",
      "resort was near the marsh, and it was the pet project of the ladies of\n",
      "Rosewater to extend it into a boulevard as far as Point Santiago, so\n",
      "that \"public picnickers\" should find an additional reason for spending\n",
      "their money in Rosewater, and extend the fame of the town. They had\n",
      "endeavored to extract the funds from their stingy lords by private\n",
      "subscription, failing an appeal to the City Fathers, who found other\n",
      "uses for the public funds; but even the civic Mr. Boutts was not ready\n",
      "for such an outlay. The women--who had accomplished so much, having\n",
      "literally transformed Rosewater from a broken-down pioneer country town\n",
      "into one of the prettiest spots in California--had by no means\n",
      "despaired; and when Mrs. Colton finished her report, Mrs. Leslie\n",
      "remarked:\n",
      "\"Our boulevard may be nearer than you think. Mr. Gwynne has conceived a\n",
      "project for reclaiming the marsh-lands, and converting them, by means of\n",
      "levees and those tremendous dredges and pumps, into arable land--like\n",
      "the reclaimed islands of the San Joaquin River; and has persuaded Tom\n",
      "Colton to present a bill to that effect at the next meeting of the\n",
      "legislature--asking for an appropriation for the levees, at least. He\n",
      "has himself promised a handsome contribution for the boulevard,\n",
      "convinced that it will add materially to the wealth and importance of\n",
      "the town. He has even talked over Mr. Boutts--an important\n",
      "conversion\"--nodding smilingly at Mrs. Boutts--\"and Isabel Otis, who has\n",
      "forty-five acres of marsh, has promised that if the bill goes through\n",
      "she will also contribute a thousand dollars. She not only realized at\n",
      "once that the boulevard would bring more capital to Rosewater, but she\n",
      "means to sow the reclaimed land with asparagus--and we all know the\n",
      "profit in that. Her attitude and comprehension of the matter have\n",
      "gratified me extremely, almost as much as her continued residence in\n",
      "Rosewater after all her fine experiences abroad; to say nothing of\n",
      "engaging personally in a lucrative business instead of playing with it\n",
      "and leaving the actual work to dishonest help. She is an example I wish\n"

      "\"I have this to say,\" she cried. \"For a lot of puritanical, prying,\n",
      "spying, detestable old hens, we take the cake. Isabel Otis minds her own\n",

      "credit to the town with her record at the High School, or wasn't she?\n",

      "business sense, the way she acted to that old reprobate of a father, or\n",
      "ain't we? That's what I want to know. And she's got real intellect\n",
      "instead of just the average American brightness; that's the secret of\n",
      "the whole trouble. What if she does sit up all night talking to a man\n",
      "who's got something besides chickens and dollars in his head? I'd do the\n",
      "same if I had the chance. Just make a note of that. If Mr. Gwynne likes\n",
      "to transfer his attentions to me I'll sit up all night right on Minerva\n",
      "Haight's doorstep, and talk about any old thing he wants. If I was as\n",
      "young and handsome as Isabel Otis I'd keep the best man going to myself,\n",
      "bet your life on it! And I repeat, it's nobody's business.\" She whirled\n",
      "upon the pallid Minerva with a flaming face. \"Nice business you're\n",
      "in--sitting at your window all night watching for other people's slips.\n",
      "You'd make one fast enough if the Lord would let you, and that's what's\n",
      "the matter with you. Now, put that in your pipe and smoke it.\"\n",
      "She sat down amid much laughter and applause. Mrs. Leslie rapped\n",
      "vigorously for order, although her mouth was twitching.\n",
      "\"Now, ladies,\" she said, suavely, \"if you have all relieved your minds I\n",
      "will say a few words. First of all, I wish to state that I shall refuse\n",
      "to put the matter to a vote. It is a question that does not come within\n",
      "the jurisdiction of the Club, which was not organized to supervise\n",
      "morals as well as streets and sewers. You can all act towards Isabel and\n",
      "Mr. Gwynne exactly as your consciences dictate, but for my own part, I\n",
      "have this to say: I am astonished to find that the Club life, a life\n",
      "which women the world over have prided themselves upon as the greatest\n",
      "factor in broadening and elevating that their sex has ever known, seems\n",
      "to have done, in our case at least, so little to eradicate certain\n",
      "Oriental instincts and traditions. The cities are full of young women\n",
      "living alone, and self-supporting. Why should not a girl have the same\n",
      "privilege in the country? Because she is handsome and distinguished? I\n",
      "fancy that a good many girls in analogous circumstances are passing\n",
      "unnoticed. I have not the least doubt that a very respectable percentage\n",
      "of very respectable young women, living alone in their city flats, sit\n",
      "up late and talk to men that are interesting enough to keep them awake.\n",
      "I am quite sure that were I young in these emancipated times I should\n",
      "take full advantage of them. And emancipated is what we pretend to\n",
      "be--although the word itself is somewhat outmoded; a healthy sign,\n",
      "proving that we are no longer labelled. And if that does not mean\n",
      "personal liberty, freedom from the old ridiculous restrictions that\n",
      "were an insult to womanhood itself, what does it mean? It is a part of\n",
      "our mission to make woman as free and independent and happy as men, and\n",
      "without the slightest danger to the old high moral standards; for no\n",
      "woman that has had it in her to go wrong ever waited for the permission\n",
      "of her own sex. We are, in fact, we Club Women, the great sieve that\n",
      "separates the wheat from the chaff; the chaff has no more use for us\n",
      "than we have for it, and we are too wise in our own sex to waste any\n",
      "time on it. The women that were born to be the playthings of men are in\n",
      "a class apart--to be dealt with, to be sure, by Societies organized for\n",
      "and experienced in that purpose; and we have not even considered them in\n",
      "the stupendous effort we have made to secure the freedom of the higher\n",
      "order of women from the old miserable social thralldoms. And what we\n",
      "have accomplished is historic.\n",
      "\"I have seen extraordinary changes in my time. When I was young a woman\n",
      "was an old maid at twenty-five. There was no appeal. To-day there are no\n",
      "old maids. Twenty years ago, in that old exclusive set of San Francisco\n",
      "led by Mrs. Yorba, Mrs. Montgomery, and for a little while by poor Mary\n",
      "Belmont, it was almost unheard of for a girl of the better class to walk\n",
      "alone on the street. If a man joined her the city fermented. Now, what\n",
      "with the influx of all these new people, the social laws have been\n",
      "modified to such an extent that my old friends must turn in their\n",
      "graves; although, of course, and very properly, a certain amount of\n",
      "chaperonage for young society girls is still demanded. But it is a mere\n",
      "harness of flowers, worn as a sort of a joke for most of the people in\n",
      "society to-day have flown upward on happy golden wings from strata\n",
      "where as much was known of chaperons as the American newspapers know\n",
      "about handling British titles. But, for my part, I find the whole change\n",
      "a vast improvement. Nothing could be duller than a girl's life in my\n",
      "time. And if society--the world of mere fashion--has broadened, how much\n",
      "more should be expected of us, who are the vanguard of our sex? who have\n",
      "set out to free women from every sort of senseless bondage they had\n",
      "endured for centuries, and no more from the tyranny of the physically\n",
      "stronger sex than through their own silliness and cowardice.\n",
      "\"We are struggling to enfranchise our sex. We would like to try our hand\n",
      "at regulating the affairs of the nation. Here, in these smaller towns,\n",
      "all over the country, we have proved a far greater power for\n",
      "improvements of all sorts than men. Rosewater owes to us, and to us\n",
      "alone, its beautifully paved and shaded streets--we have no difficulty\n",
      "in remembering what a barren mud-hole it was--the trees that shade the\n",
      "poor horses at the hitching-rails; the beautiful squares, the tropical\n",
      "plants and trees, the improved sewerage system, the cleanliness of the\n",
      "marsh border, everything in fact that has transformed Rosewater from a\n",
      "mere set of roofs and walls into a delightfully habitable town.\n",
      "Moreover, we have raised both the moral and the intellectual tone, for\n",
      "although I at least have always discouraged too much interest in\n",
      "people's private affairs, the higher interests, and the increased\n",
      "intimacy among women, have done much to keep them out of mischief. Until\n",
      "this card fever descended upon the town, it was generally regarded as\n",
      "occupying a high place among communities of its size. Cards, however, I\n",
      "regard as a passing madness; it merely means that even yet we have not\n",
      "enough to do.\n",
      "\"And--so it seems!--in spite of all that we have accomplished, in spite\n",
      "of our long and ofttimes disheartening struggle to lift ourselves above\n",
      "the average female woman, we are as ready to tear reputations to pieces\n",
      "as ever, to judge by mere appearances, to discount general character and\n",
      "behavior, to forget our ideals and give unlicensed rein to the mean and\n",
      "detestable qualities we still cherish in common with the mass of\n",
      "unenlightened women. I do not assert that I have never heard gossip from\n",
      "men; but it has always been from the men that spend their lives in Club\n",
      "windows, never from men that had some better way of filling their time.\n",
      "From my husband I have never heard a scurrilous word of any one, and he\n",
      "has a temper of his own, too. Now, so far as I can make out, we have not\n",
      "only been trying to usurp the time-honored prerogatives of men, but to\n",
      "attain their highest standards. While I deprecate violence of statement,\n",
      "I am inclined to agree with Mrs. Toffitt that a woman belonging to this\n",
      "Club, a Club which stands high in the Club life of the State, should\n",
      "have something better to do than to spend the night at her window spying\n",
      "on her neighbors. If she cannot sleep she can improve her mind or sew\n",
      "for the poor. If a man engaged in such nefarious night work and brazenly\n",
      "admitted it, I will venture to say that his Club, or his Lodge, at all\n",
      "events, would ask for his resignation. It would be quite in order with\n",
      "our avowed principles that we reprimanded Mrs. Haight instead of Miss\n",
      "Otis, but we will let the matter pass this time with a mere hint. One\n",
      "point is, by-the-way, that the latter not being a member of the Club it\n",
      "would be the height of impertinence to take her to task. But in any case\n",
      "I personally refuse even to consider the question of anything being\n",
      "otherwise with her than it should be. There is, no doubt, some wholly\n",
      "commonplace explanation of Mr. Gwynne's passing through Rosewater on her\n",
      "horse this morning. As for their constant companionship, what more\n",
      "natural? They are closely related, and she has been a very necessary\n",
      "sister to him. Nevertheless, I shall make it my unpleasant business to\n",
      "tell her that we are still the same old females, still incapable of\n",
      "conceiving of aught but one relationship between unmarried members of\n",
      "opposite sexes, that our imaginations and our positive knowledge of life\n",
      "are alike undeveloped. Then she can take a chaperon or not as she\n",
      "pleases. She will always be welcome in my house; and as for my daughter,\n",
      "she will only laugh at this tempest of her elders in a tea-pot. That is\n",
      "all I have to say.\"\n",
      "She finished amid much applause, some shamefaced, some hearty, but there\n",
      "were a number of lowering brows. When adjournment was declared a few\n",
      "moments later, she left at once, but the others remained to talk the\n",
      "matter over. The ingrained love of finding our sister worse than\n",
      "ourselves is not to be eradicated by a few years of Club life, and\n",
      "although the majority decided that Mrs. Leslie was quite in the right,\n",
      "several announced their intention to cut Isabel Otis. There was no\n",
      "informal resolution taken to ignore the matter, and, on the whole, Mrs.\n",
      "Haight went home with her crest up, and Mrs. Wheaton fasted for three\n",
      "days.\n",
      "XXIX\n",
      "Mrs. Leslie was a brave woman, but when the judge suggested that it\n",
      "would be better for him to talk the matter over with Gwynne, obtain his\n",
      "explanation, and delicately hint the attitude of the town, she was\n",
      "nothing loath to renounce her mission. \"The dear child,\" the friends of\n",
      "her mother all remembered, had once possessed a temper that only the\n",
      "peculiar circumstances of her life had chastened, and they had an uneasy\n",
      "suspicion that it still smouldered beneath the well-bred insolence with\n",
      "which she had so far received much friendly advice.\n",
      "By this time--mid-December was nigh--the judge and Gwynne had discussed\n",
      "many subjects besides the law. Mrs. Leslie, whose hospitable instincts\n",
      "were too deep to be blighted even by the servant question, had placed a\n",
      "room at Gwynne's disposal to be used when it rained, or he talked so\n",
      "late with the judge that the long ride home was not worth while. He\n",
      "dined with them several times a week, and found both these simple\n",
      "old-fashioned people delightful. And with Judge Leslie, alone of all his\n",
      "neighbors, could he discuss the affairs of the great world, get away\n",
      "from the politics and the small local interests that absorbed every\n",
      "other man in Rosewater. Moreover, Judge Leslie was well acquainted with\n",
      "his past career and often manifested a keen desire for details. Gwynne\n",
      "was not sure that these lapses were good for him, but certainly it was\n",
      "pleasant, stretched out there by the big fireplace in an old room full\n",
      "of books, English for the most part, to talk of himself and his\n",
      "achievements. Isabel rarely referred to his past, never encouraged him\n",
      "to talk about it. His mother had become as silent as a mummy; old man\n",
      "Colton might have lost his memory, and for Tom Colton British politics\n",
      "had no existence.\n",
      "But Judge Leslie understood and had much sympathy for his\n",
      "pupil--possibly believed in the virtue of the safety-valve. Certainly\n",
      "Gwynne invariably went to bed after these long talks content in mind and\n",
      "body; and the next day he was far too busy to trot out his ego and sit\n",
      "down with it. And his mind at least was happy in its new sense of\n",
      "expansion and acquisition, its increasing and developing powers. His\n",
      "studies had the further effect of moderating the purely personal\n",
      "viewpoint of the United States that had tormented him, and of enabling\n",
      "him to withdraw far enough to command glimpses of the New World as a\n",
      "great abstraction. And his contacts with the strange medley of small\n",
      "farmers and mechanics, with local politicians in back offices and\n",
      "saloons, even his acquaintance with the San Franciscans that were\n",
      "attempting to reclaim that bawdy borough, did not affect the universal\n",
      "idea he had at last succeeded in focussing. He had cast out disgust and\n",
      "disapproval as youthful and unphilosophical, resolved anew to play his\n",
      "part in the history of the country, letting the unborn events of his\n",
      "term of enforced quiescence determine what the part must be. He had not\n",
      "yet reached the stage of enthusiasm, but he had at least mounted to that\n",
      "of interest; and he had even caught himself wondering if, should a law\n",
      "pass in Great Britain, reducing the House of Peers to an elective body,\n",
      "or permitting peers of his grade to sit in the House of Commons, he\n",
      "would return? There was little doubt that there was more good to be\n",
      "accomplished in the new country.\n",
      "His English great-great-grandfather had been historically active in the\n",
      "reforms of 1832; a great-uncle had devoted his services to the passing\n",
      "of the Reform Act of 1867; and a cousin to the Corrupt Practices Act of\n",
      "1883. Reform was in his blood, and as, after all, the United States was\n",
      "as much his own as Great Britain, he hoped in time to feel for it the\n",
      "same passion of affection he had cherished for the country that had\n",
      "given him fame and honors with both hands. And he knew that his other\n",
      "hope of being of practical service to the United States in accordance\n",
      "with his own ideal was no idle dream, for it was quite apparent from the\n",
      "newspapers and reviews that the best men all over the country were awake\n",
      "at last to the perils besetting the Republic, and that a bloodless\n",
      "revolution was slowly making its way over the country. He had\n",
      "unmitigated contempt for the revolutionist of the red shirt, insatiable\n",
      "for the notoriety so easily obtained by appealing to the passions of men\n",
      "a shade more ignorant than himself; no blood revolution was possible in\n",
      "the United States during its present condition of prosperity. No country\n",
      "can be universally roused to revolt with any weapons more deadly than\n",
      "words until it has long felt the pinch of hunger in its vitals, and\n",
      "watched millions starve while hundreds consumed the fat of the land. No\n",
      "doubt there was grinding poverty in the crowded tenement districts of\n",
      "the Eastern States, but those men were not the stuff of which\n",
      "revolutionists were made, if only because they deliberately elected the\n",
      "rigors of the town rather than supply the crying demand for labor and\n",
      "servants throughout the country. It was only the idle that foregathered\n",
      "and talked anarchism or even socialism; not those that cared to work.\n",
      "Here in California there was practically no such thing as poverty, or if\n",
      "there was, the pauper, if fairly able of body, should be set up in a\n",
      "public pillory. With a scale of wages the highest in the world, a\n",
      "corresponding cheapness of every necessity of life, with the bare\n",
      "exception of coal, needed in excess during one short season of the\n",
      "twelve-month, sun for eight unbroken months, and a soil so fertile that\n",
      "in many places it yielded two crops a year, there would have been no\n",
      "discontent had it not been for the rapacity of labor unions, and the\n",
      "systematic agitations of men like Tom Colton. In every human heart there\n",
      "is the germ of discontent, no matter what the conditions, but Gwynne\n",
      "recognized the possibility of diverting this uneasy parasite from\n",
      "imaginary personal grievances to the public good, to measures which\n",
      "would benefit the mass, subtly elevating man's opinion of himself in the\n",
      "process, and so taking the first long stride in the direction of general\n",
      "political reform. It was only by making the masses see their own part in\n",
      "the abominable political corruption that made \"graft\" universal, and\n",
      "permitted the rapid concentration of the country's wealth into a few\n",
      "insolent hands, that the decapitation of the swarms of professional\n",
      "politicians could be accomplished. In no part of the United States could\n",
      "such reforms be attempted with anything like the same prospect of\n",
      "success, as in this State with its traditions of contempt of money for\n",
      "its own sake, and its almost primeval sense of independence. It was true\n",
      "that there was no superb indifference to money in the small towns, but\n",
      "much of the old spirit lingered among those that lived close to the\n",
      "soil; and Gwynne had never seen such uncalculating lavishness, such a\n",
      "humorous contempt for economy as in San Francisco. He was himself\n",
      "generous by instinct and habit, but this gay reckless openhandedness,\n",
      "whether a man had anything to spend or not, had already stirred some\n",
      "deeper instinct still, possibly his pioneer, perhaps his Spanish, and he\n",
      "had never enjoyed anything more in his life than certain nights in San\n",
      "Francisco, when he had sallied forth with his pockets full of gold and\n",
      "returned to Russian Hill on foot for want of a five-cent piece to pay\n",
      "his car-fare. He had himself too well in hand ever to give permanent\n",
      "rein to any such latent propensities, and he had no intention of\n",
      "impoverishing himself, but the fact that the genius of the city was in\n",
      "his blood warmed it to the strange, fascinating, wicked, friendly,\n",
      "young-old city on the rim of the Pacific.\n",
      "As it happened, he was not in the humor for reading on the morning after\n",
      "the meeting of the female clans, nor were there any clients in the outer\n",
      "office, and he uttered some of his impressions aloud to the judge who\n",
      "was sitting restlessly by the window, ostensibly watching Main Street.\n",
      "Gwynne had wondered at the old gentleman's sudden idleness, but fell\n",
      "easily into conversation this languid morning that was more like spring\n",
      "than belated winter.\n",
      "\"I can understand the fascination of San Francisco for anybody,\" said\n",
      "the uneasy judge. \"I wonder--\" with a sudden inspiration, \"if it\n",
      "wouldn't be better for you to go into the law-office of a friend of mine\n",
      "down there for a while. I mean--\" in response to Gwynne's look of\n",
      "astonishment, \"of course I should hate to lose you--quite as much as I\n",
      "hated to lose my own son, and yours is the only society in which I have\n",
      "found any positive refreshment for years. But--well! in fact it would\n",
      "be as well for you to leave Rosewater for a while--until all this talk\n",
      "has died out.\"\n",
      "\"What talk?\"\n",
      "The judge felt what courage was left in him oozing under Gwynne's icy\n",
      "stare.\n",
      "\"Oh Lord! It's just this, Gwynne--just fancy I am really your father.\n",
      "There are a lot of infernal old hens in this town--where don't they\n",
      "roost, anyway?--and they have been exercising themselves over your going\n",
      "out to Isabel's so much, especially at night. They've got the idea into\n",
      "their empty heads that Isabel has come back from Europe, where she lived\n",
      "by herself, with all sorts of free-and-easy notions. Perhaps the real\n",
      "truth is that they distrust any girl as handsome as that who won't\n",
      "marry. The talk didn't amount to much until yesterday morning--\"\n",
      "\"Ah!\" Gwynne stood up and took his hat from the little private rack.\n",
      "\"Suppose you ask Mrs. Leslie to tell the hens that I have spent a great\n",
      "many futile evening hours, the only ones I have at my private disposal,\n",
      "trying to induce Miss Otis to marry me, and that yesterday evening,\n",
      "after the fourth or fifth refusal, I borrowed her horse, having walked\n",
      "out, and rode half-way to San Francisco to steady my nerves. Love and\n",
      "the law combined are somewhat of a load to carry. I will go out now and\n",
      "try my luck again. Perhaps this talk will influence her a bit. In fact I\n",
      "promise that it shall.\"\n",
      "XXX\n",
      "Gwynne found Isabel just stepping out of her launch, after a business\n",
      "morning in Rosewater, and was hospitably invited to dismount and remain\n",
      "for luncheon.\n",
      "\"Would you mind asking your Jap to make us some sandwiches and come with\n",
      "me up to my mountain shanty?\" he asked. \"I have rather a headache and\n",
      "want a long ride. Besides, it is high time I went. I should look over\n",
      "the roads, which they tell me are very bad after the heavy rains. I want\n",
      "to go into camp there in the early spring--have invited Hofer and one or\n",
      "two others for salmon-fishing. I have now sent three letters to the\n",
      "tenant, one Clink, by teamsters, and he has never replied. For all I\n",
      "know he may have burned the house down and decamped. So, altogether,\n",
      "this seems to me the time to go, and it would be very jolly to have you\n",
      "with me.\"\n",
      "\"I'd like nothing better,\" said Isabel, delightedly, \"after talking eggs\n",
      "and chickens all morning. And I haven't been up to Mountain House for\n",
      "years. It used to belong to Uncle Hiram, you know. He always fished\n",
      "there in the spring, and took me with him. Then Mr. Colton bought it\n",
      "in--I won't be ten minutes.\"\n",
      "\"Now I know why you wear that hideous divided habit and ride astride,\"\n",
      "said Gwynne as they started. \"I have been half-way up the mountain once\n",
      "or twice, to say nothing of the Marin hills, and I have never seen such\n",
      "roads. They are a disgrace to the State. Why on earth doesn't the\n",
      "legislature take them in hand?\"\n",
      "\"Now _I_ know _you_ are in a bad humor,\" said Isabel, laughing. \"You\n",
      "grumbled at everything when you first came to California, and now that\n",
      "you have become philosophical like the rest of us, you only anathematize\n",
      "when you are put out. I saw something was wrong the moment you arrived.\n",
      "What is it?\"\n",
      "\"I'll tell you later. This is our only chance for a sharp trot.\"\n",
      "It was quite two miles to the ascending road at the foot of the mountain\n",
      "range that divided the great valley. It rose gently for a time then\n",
      "suddenly became steep. Lumpy and slanting, already dangerously narrow in\n",
      "many places, for there had been a few days of hard rain, it led along\n",
      "the edge of cannons and chasms, creeks and little valleys as round as\n",
      "a bowl. Here and there was a farmhouse or a country home on a slope, set\n",
      "in the midst of fields just turning green. The first stretch of\n",
      "road--cut roughly in the mountain-side and then left to take care of\n",
      "itself--was on county property, but after an hour's climb along the\n",
      "flank of the mountain they reached the part of the great mass included\n",
      "in Lumalitas, where the road, although still public, had been mended now\n",
      "and again by tenants that had used the camp in the fishing season.\n",
      "\"It is even worse than I thought,\" grumbled Gwynne. \"I wonder if Tom\n",
      "Colton could be induced to put in a bill at the next legislature. It\n",
      "would be a good opportunity for him to make a promise with some hope of\n",
      "fulfilment.\"\n",
      "\"The trouble is the farmers don't care,\" said Isabel, shrugging her\n",
      "shoulders. \"There are only a few of them in the mountains and they have\n",
      "jogged up and down these bad roads so many years that they accept them\n",
      "as a matter of course. I don't know that I mind this, myself. It\n",
      "certainly is more picturesque than if it had become popular with\n",
      "automobilists of much influence in legislative councils.\"\n",
      "\"At present you have to ride with your eyes on the road to make sure it\n",
      "is there.\"\n",
      "\"We can take turns, and it certainly is beautiful.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, beautiful!\"\n",
      "But when the road improved for quite half a mile, he too gave himself up\n",
      "to the sensation of being lost in the heart of a mountain. The valley\n",
      "was far behind them and out of sight. There were groves of ancient oaks\n",
      "in the hollows, turbulent streams foaming over masses of rocks that had\n",
      "fallen from the cliffs above. Sometimes they looked down a thousand\n",
      "sheer feet into a bit of wilderness as unbroken as if on each side of\n",
      "the range man had not snatched the fertile lands from the savage a\n",
      "century before.\n",
      "The air grew colder and Isabel put on her covert coat. But it was a\n",
      "clear sparkling day, and when they reached the summit they could see San\n",
      "Francisco, a smoky mirage forty miles to the south, the ferry-boats\n",
      "crawling like beetles across the bay, the surf of the ocean on the rocks\n",
      "beyond the Golden Gate, a vast sweep of gray ocean; and the bulk of\n",
      "Tamalpais, that from this high point looked as if it had heaved itself\n",
      "free of the mass of mountains and forests about it. Two thousand feet\n",
      "below, their own valley, with its marsh and fertile ranches, looked like\n",
      "a dark ribbon between the hills, Rosewater like a toy village.\n",
      "They trotted their horses for a few moments on the level and then rode\n",
      "down into the little valley where an unsuccessful farmer of solitary\n",
      "habit had some time since rented the few acres of land surrounding\n",
      "Mountain House, with the understanding that the best rooms were to be at\n",
      "the disposal of the lord of Lumalitas during the fishing and hunting\n",
      "seasons. The log-house, or \"camp,\" was very solid and had been built by\n",
      "the first James Otis, who was a mighty hunter; and the salmon-fishing in\n",
      "the creek, at present containing but a few feet of water, was so fine\n",
      "that hardly a spring had passed without a visit from the tenants of\n",
      "Lumalitas, who were constrained by the terms of the lease to keep the\n",
      "house in repair. Of late this had been the duty of the sub-lessee, and\n",
      "as no teams passed his isolated dwelling, and as he had not seen fit to\n",
      "answer his landlord's communications, even verbally, by the boy from one\n",
      "of the lower ranches who had carried up the missives, all Gwynne knew\n",
      "was that Mr. Clink was alive, and that the ranch was free of winter\n",
      "debris.\n",
      "They found the gentleman sitting on a stump. He had a hand on either\n",
      "knee, and his small watery unblinking eyes were fixed on space. A beard,\n",
      "narrow and grizzled and stained, rested on his lean front, or stirred\n",
      "gently in the breeze. He neither rose, nor otherwise noticed the\n",
      "approach of his visitors.\n",
      "Gwynne called, shouted, approached the verge of profanity, but he might\n",
      "as well have addressed the silent forest.\n",
      "Isabel elevated her nose. \"To use the vernacular, he is on a long, slow,\n",
      "melancholy jag. I will go in and see how he keeps the house. It needs an\n",
      "airing at least. Every window is closed and probably has been all\n",
      "winter.\"\n",
      "She remained in-doors half an hour, putting things to rights with many\n",
      "mysterious touches known only to her sex. When she returned to Gwynne\n",
      "she found him sunning himself on the porch with his back to Mr. Clink,\n",
      "who stolidly regarded an old stump of geranium.\n",
      "\"It is clean enough,\" she said. \"But when you come, bring new\n",
      "blankets--or send them, and your provisions--the day before you bring\n",
      "your guests. I will come up with them and see that everything is in\n",
      "order. I might also turn the hose on Clink, if he has chosen that\n",
      "occasion to drench himself inside. At all events bring a cook--you can\n",
      "have Chuma; these people never can cook anything but fried meat and\n",
      "potatoes.\"\n",
      "Drifted leaves lay on the porch a foot deep. Isabel found a broom and\n",
      "swept vigorously, snubbing Gwynne's offer to do it himself. He watched\n",
      "her, crossly reflecting that she was never so unattractive as in that\n",
      "dust-colored divided habit, and wishing that he had waited for the\n",
      "evening hour; even if infrequently seductive, she was always lovely in a\n",
      "becoming gown.\n",
      "Finally, her labors over, she dusted an aged rocking-chair and sat down,\n",
      "fanning herself with her hat. Her cheeks were flushed and her eyes\n",
      "sparkling, but she turned to look at the beautiful creek that had torn\n",
      "its way through the forest, and Gwynne suddenly felt that he hated her\n",
      "profile. During the last few weeks he had lost that sense of a constant\n",
      "and secret contest of wills, perhaps because his own had proved the\n",
      "stronger in the final engagement; perhaps, who knew? because she\n",
      "possessed all the infernal subtlety of the Spaniard. But her profile\n",
      "suggested relentless power, and he still had a secret hankering for the\n",
      "old-fashioned submissive female, liberal and indulgent to the sex as he\n",
      "was. He had reflected that he had met so many handsome finely developed\n",
      "girls, with a sufficiency of animated brightness, but well within the\n",
      "type, during the past few weeks, that it was rather odd he had not been\n",
      "captured; particularly as several of the most ripping would add\n",
      "materially to his fortunes. But he had come to the conclusion sometime\n",
      "since, when he hardly knew, that he would prefer to remain unmarried,\n",
      "and enjoy the intimate companionship of a congenial and interesting\n",
      "creature like Isabel, whom he never quite understood. He cursed the\n",
      "stale old conventions that interfered with his desires.\n",
      "Isabel turned suddenly and smiled. \"How fierce you look!\" she said.\n",
      "\"What is the matter?\"\n",
      "\"Everything. Some one, Mrs. Haight, I suppose, saw me riding home on\n",
      "your horse at three o'clock yesterday morning, and the whole town is by\n",
      "the ears. Judge Leslie undertook to break the news to me, and I told him\n",
      "I had gone out to propose, and then ridden about the country to calm my\n",
      "raging fires. I feel that I owe it to you to propose in good earnest,\n",
      "and such as I am you are welcome to me.\"\n",
      "\"I never heard such a graceful proposal. I wouldn't marry you if\n",
      "Rosewater stood on its head.\"\n",
      "\"I was rather brutal about it, and I must honestly confess that I'm not\n",
      "particularly keen on marrying you, but I think we'll have to marry, or\n",
      "be deuced uncomfortable--\"\n",
      "\"Oh, nothing to what we should be if married. And Rosewater to me is a\n",
      "mere market for chickens and eggs. The only punishment they could\n",
      "inflict on me would be to burn down the hatcheries. I hate to bother\n",
      "with incubators.\"\n",
      "Gwynne stood up and knocked the ashes out of his pipe. \"We must be\n",
      "serious,\" he said. \"They are really malignant about it. I have felt it\n",
      "in the air for some time. Every time I pass that she-devil, Mrs. Haight,\n",
      "on Main Street, her eyes contract with a sort of malicious warning.\n",
      "'Just you wait!' is the way she would phrase it. And I always _feel_ her\n",
      "at her window when I ride home late. No woman of your age and beauty can\n",
      "defy public opinion alone. The world--and scandal spreads like a plague;\n",
      "San Francisco is only forty miles from Rosewater--the world can hurt you\n",
      "in a thousand ways, ruin your life. I really am only too willing to\n",
      "protect you, and I hope that you will marry me. I am sure we should get\n",
      "along--after a bit.\"\n",
      "\"That was better. But I will not be driven into matrimony by gossip, or\n",
      "even scandal. That is no part of my scheme of life. And I know Rosewater\n",
      "better than you do. Mrs. Leslie, Anabel, Mrs. Colton, many of the most\n",
      "powerful, would never believe a word against me.\"\n",
      "\"Not at first. But malicious tongues will wear the gloss from the\n",
      "best-befriended reputation in time. The kindest natures are\n",
      "conventional; and susceptible to all that take, or seem to take, a place\n",
      "in the ranks of established facts.\"\n",
      "\"I won't do it,\" said Isabel, stubbornly; and as she turned her profile\n",
      "to him he almost swore aloud. \"I shall conquer, or prove the whole\n",

      "adore them, and when I am a millionaire I shall have little shovels full\n",
      "like those you see in jewellers' windows, just to handle; and the most\n",
      "lovely combinations to wear. But I don't ruin my complexion pining for\n",
      "what I can't have--or have lost. Of course poor mamma had beautiful\n",
      "jewels, but they went the way of all things.\"\n",
      "Gwynne looked at his watch. \"I shall get a bite in town,\" he said. \"The\n",
      "shops will be open till midnight. Hofer will endorse a check for me; I\n",
      "have sold three farms in the past week and have a pot of money in the\n",
      "bank. There is something else I want you to wear to-night--\"\n",
      "\"I won't take jewels from you--\"\n",
      "\"You are not only my fiancee but my cousin--\"\n",
      "\"Nonsense!\"\n",

      "and her eyes danced with anticipation. After all, she could return his\n",
      "present when the farce was over, and she was in a mood to have the world\n",
      "poured into her lap.\n",
      "She dined alone with her Puritan and Spanish ancestors, and when the\n",
      "brief meal was over, went up and exhibited herself to Lady Victoria, who\n",
      "was in a state of silent fury at being the victim of a headache. She\n",
      "complimented Isabel upon her appearance, however, and added:\n",
      "\"I hope this pretended engagement will end in reality. You are of our\n",
      "blood. I recognize it more and more. I am thankful he escaped Julia\n",
      "Kaye. You are--could be--all I am afraid I compelled myself to believe\n",
      "she was.\"\n",
      "\"Do you want him to go back to England?\" asked Isabel. \"I had a letter\n",
      "from Flora the other day, and she thinks it is my mission to restore him\n",
      "to his country.\"\n",
      "\"I don't care. What difference does it make? I want him to be happy, and\n",
      "he can have a career anywhere. In your case beauty is not a curse, and I\n",
      "should be glad to see you concentrate your gifts where you can find and\n",
      "give real happiness. Now, enjoy yourself like a girl to-night and don't\n",
      "bother about Jack or any one else--certainly not about me,\" as Isabel\n",
      "stood looking down upon her with a puckered brow.\n",
      "Lady Victoria, in a negligee of salmon pink under a red light, and\n",
      "reclining on her divan with a box of cigarettes beside her, and a French\n",
      "novel in her hand, looked little less handsome than when she had\n",
      "captivated Isabel's girlish fancy a year ago. It was only the utter\n",
      "weariness of the eyes, and a subtle hardening of the whole mask of the\n",
      "always immobile face, that betrayed the sudden rupture with a long\n",
      "complacent youth. But she looked at Isabel's glorious youth without a\n",
      "pang of envy in her cynical, if not yet philosophical, soul, and said\n",
      "again, with emphasis:\n",
      "\"Marry him. You can do it. Any woman can marry any man she wants. That\n",
      "is the reason we are never really happy. We never love men, as we\n",
      "imagine that we could love. We have fevers for them that last a few\n",
      "weeks, and then we become maternal and endure them. We might love a\n",
      "demi-god, never man as we know him. Perhaps in some other world--who\n",
      "knows?\"\n",
      "Isabel pricked up her ears. Was Lady Victoria meditating the\n",
      "consolations of the Church--or of Flora's more modern substitute? What a\n",
      "solution! But she dared not ask. She was still a little afraid of her\n",
      "complicated relative. She begged her not to read too late, and went out,\n",
      "promising to conciliate the offended Mrs. Hofer.\n",
      "As she walked down the hall she stooped absently and picked up a scrap\n",
      "of paper, hardly aware that she held it in her hand until she sat down\n",
      "once more before her mirror. Then she glanced at it. To her surprise it\n",
      "was an advertisement of a prize-fight, cut from a newspaper; and on the\n",
      "margin an illiterate hand had scrawled, \"_Nine o'clock sharp._\" She\n",
      "wondered which of the servants was indulging in the distractions of the\n",
      "ring. All except Lady Victoria's maid were Japs. Could the Frenchwoman\n",
      "have found a lover who had introduced her to the forbidden pleasures of\n",
      "the town? Obviously it was not Gwynne's for the date was two days old,\n",
      "and he had been in Menlo Park at the time. But she had more interesting\n",
      "things to ponder over. Being a good housekeeper, she folded the scrap\n",
      "and hid it under one of the little silver trays, intending to give it in\n",
      "the morning to Lady Victoria, who was the temporary mistress of the\n",
      "mansion. Then she fell to counting her pearls, wound them twice about\n",
      "her throat, decided that she preferred the single long ellipse falling\n",
      "among the blue flowers on her bosom, marvelled, in an abandon of\n",
      "femininity, at the dazzling whiteness of her skin. She was beautiful, no\n",
      "doubt of that; it might be as Lady Victoria and Flora Thangue asserted,\n",
      "that any future she chose was hers to command; and, as the latter had\n",
      "intimated, to be an English peeress, with her husband at the head of the\n",
      "state, was no mean destiny. To-night, her almost fanatical love of\n",
      "California was dormant. She felt wholly personal. Whatever the future,\n",
      "she wanted to be the most admired girl at this party to-night, to\n",
      "dominate its long-heralded splendors as a great soprano rises high and\n",
      "triumphant above the orchestral thunders of a Wagner opera. Old\n",
      "instincts were stirring subtly. She had the rest of her life for great\n",
      "ideals. To-night she would be an old-time belle: as Concha Argueello had\n",
      "been just a century ago, as Guadalupe Hathaway, Mrs. Hunt McLane, Nina\n",
      "Randolph, and \"The Three Macs,\" had been in the city's youth; as Helena\n",
      "Belmont had been but twenty years before. She recalled the oft-told\n",
      "story of the night of Mrs. Yorba's great ball, in the house next to the\n",
      "one which was to be the theatre of her own debut, when Magdalena Yorba,\n",
      "Tiny Montgomery, Ila Brannan, and the wonderful Helena had been\n",
      "introduced to San Francisco, and the most distracting belle the town had\n",
      "ever known had turned the heads of fifty men. It was far easier to be a\n",
      "belle in that simpler time than to-day, when the San Franciscan vied\n",
      "with the New-Yorker in the magnificence of furnishing and attire, and a\n",
      "mere million was no longer a fortune. And the city more than maintained\n",
      "its old standard of beauty, for its population had nearly doubled; the\n",
      "handsome girls of the upper class had learned the art of dress, and even\n",
      "among the shop-girls there was a surfeit of pretty faces and fine busts.\n",
      "As to the demi-monde it was the pick of America, for obvious reason.\n",
      "But Isabel was an ardent dreamer, and as she sat in her silent old home,\n",
      "high above the city's unresting life, she imagined herself into a\n",
      "blissful picture where she should realize to the full all the desires\n",
      "dear to the heart of a girl. It was true that she had created a _furore_\n",
      "that night at Arcot, but her triumph had been extinguished by fright and\n",
      "the tragedies that came in its train. And no triumph abroad ever quite\n",
      "equals the conquest of your own territory. Isabel concluded that if it\n",
      "were a matter of a single season, she would rather reign in San\n",
      "Francisco than in London--but her dreams were cut short by Gwynne's\n",
      "rapid step on the plank walk, and a moment later he was tapping on her\n",
      "door.\n",
      "She looked up at him with undisguised expectancy.\n",
      "\"I am going to enjoy it,\" she said. \"I shall accept it. I don't care!\"\n",
      "\"I should hope so, after all the trouble I have had.\" He sat down in a\n",
      "low chair beside the dressing-table and facing her. \"Hofer had been\n",
      "turned out of the house and had taken refuge at the Mission. I took an\n",
      "automobile and rushed out there, only to find that he and his friends\n",
      "had concluded to come in and dine at one of the restaurants. Definite,\n",
      "but I know their tastes pretty well, and finally tracked them down. By\n",
      "that time I was starved, but when the dinner was over Hofer went with me\n",
      "himself to the jeweller's--\"\n",
      "\"What is it?\" asked Isabel, impatiently, her eyes on a long box Gwynne\n",
      "had taken from his pocket.\n",
      "But Gwynne seldom had an opportunity to tease her. He drew his finger\n",
      "along the heavy coil of hair that rose from the very nape of her neck\n",
      "and pushed forward a soft little mass on to the brow. \"I have always\n",
      "wanted to see something here,\" he said. \"I remember once seeing a lovely\n",
      "print of the Empress Elizabeth of Austria, who wore her hair somewhat as\n",
      "you do--\"\n",
      "\"Not a bit of it. Her hair was generally half-way down her back--\"\n",
      "\"Well the effect was the same--and in this print she had a row of\n",
      "daisies or stars; I never could remember which--\"\n",
      "\"You haven't brought me daisies?\" said Isabel, in disgust.\n",
      "Gwynne pressed the little gilt nob, and as the lid flew up Isabel cried\n",
      "out, with delight.\n",
      "\"You shouldn't! But I don't care! I said I wouldn't. I never expected\n",
      "anything so gorgeous, though--\"\n",
      "She caught the box from his hand and fastened the diamond stars in the\n",
      "line he had indicated. There were five, graduated in size, and they gave\n",
      "her beauty its final touch of poetry and light. Isabel gazed at her\n",
      "dazzling reflection with parted lips and dancing eyes, then turned\n",
      "impulsively, flung her arms about Gwynne's neck, and kissed him. He\n",
      "pushed her away roughly.\n",
      "\"Don't do that again!\" he said. \"I am not your brother, nor one of your\n",
      "girl friends. Can I look about? I have always had a curiosity to see\n",
      "this room. I had an idea that it was different from the one at the\n",
      "ranch.\"\n",
      "\"You can look at what you like,\" said Isabel, indifferently. \"I shall\n",
      "look at my stars. _Madre de Dios!_ as our Spanish ancestors would have\n",
      "said. _Ay yi! Valgame Dios! Dios de mi alma! Dios de mi vida!_ I never\n",
      "was so happy in my life.\"\n",
      "Gwynne walked about the large old-fashioned room with its bow-window,\n",
      "and alcove for the bed. He had half expected that the room he had so\n",
      "often passed with reluctant steps would be furnished in blue or pink,\n",
      "but it was as red as that of the traditional queen. Isabel had brought\n",
      "up all the old crimson damask curtains that had been fashionable in her\n",
      "grandmother's time, and covered the windows and walls of her bedroom,\n",
      "even the head of the mahogany four-poster in which her mother and\n",
      "herself had been born. The carpet was new, but a dull crimson, like the\n",
      "faded hangings, and the dressing-table with its quantity of chased\n",
      "silver--one of the few inheritances she had managed to retain--was the\n",
      "only spot of light in the rather sombre room: it was all white muslin\n",
      "and bright crimson silk. There was an old-fashioned settle against the\n",
      "wall and three stiff chairs. Gwynne liked the room, and had a vague\n",
      "feeling that he knew Isabel a little better. Certainly it expressed a\n",
      "side of her of which he had caught but an occasional glimpse.\n",
      "He pulled the curtains apart and shading his eyes from the light of the\n",
      "room looked down towards the city. It had vanished under a sea of white\n",
      "fog that broke against the ledge of Nob Hill. A cable-car might have\n",
      "been a comet flashing along the edge of a void.\n",
      "\"I wonder,\" he said, \"I wonder--should San Francisco disappear--be\n",
      "burned by that fire you are always expecting--or if the bay should\n",
      "shoal, or the Golden Gate rush together, so that she would have no\n",
      "reason for existence, and gradually be devoured by time--I suppose the\n",
      "fog and the winds would still be faithful. I can imagine the fogs\n",
      "rolling in and embracing her, and the winds raging about every forgotten\n",
      "corner, centuries after there was anybody left to curse either.\"\n",
      "\"Was it Mrs. Kaye or Lady Cecilia Spence that said you just missed being\n",
      "a poet? I hope some slumbering ancestor is not struggling for\n",
      "resurrection out here. I much prefer that you should be a statesman.\"\n",
      "\"I intend to be, nor have I any desire to turn poet. I have seen too\n",
      "many in London. But this city, ugly as it is, appeals in its own way to\n",
      "the imagination--more, for some unknown reason, than the most poetic I\n",
      "ever saw in the old worlds. There is something almost uncanny about it.\n",
      "While it is raw, and crude, and practically in its infancy, it at the\n",
      "same time suggests an unthinkable antiquity. Perhaps--who knows?--it had\n",
      "a civilization contemporary with the Montezumas--or with Atlantis; and\n",
      "it is the ghosts of old unrecorded peoples that linger and give one a\n",
      "fairly haunted feeling when one climbs these hills alone at night.\"\n",
      "\"Much better you keep your hand on your pistol and your eye out for\n",
      "foot-pads--and one dreamer in the family is enough. I hope I have not\n",
      "infected you.\"\n",
      "She forsook her glowing image and looked at him inquisitively. He\n",
      "wandered about the room again and paused to look at a row of\n",
      "daguerreotypes on a shelf, dead and forgotten Belmonts.\n",
      "\"You do dream a good deal,\" he said. \"Judging by your varying styles of\n",
      "beauty as well as other things, you must be possessed by a dozen\n",
      "different sorts of old Johnnies trying to mutter something up out of the\n",
      "dark.\"\n",
      "\"I'm going to be nothing but a dreamer for a whole week.\"\n",
      "\"If that means that you will forget chickens, and dress yourself\n",
      "decently, I shall do what I can to heighten the illusion. Should you\n",
      "like me to make love to you?\" he asked, turning to her with a quickening\n",
      "interest.\n",
      "\"That might wake me up,\" said Isabel, politely. \"This week is crowded\n",
      "with parties and things. I am to visit Mrs. Hofer and go to all of them.\n",
      "You won't see much of me until New Year's eve, when I come home and we\n",
      "dine at a Bohemian restaurant with Lyster and Paula, and watch the\n",
      "street crowds after. But I do not look so far ahead. If I am a success\n",
      "to-night I am going to make believe that I am an old-time belle like\n",
      "Helena Belmont, or my poor little mother, for that matter. And I shall\n",
      "feel just like her when I start, for Angelique will pin up my skirts\n",
      "under a long cloak, and pull carriage boots over my slippers so that\n",
      "nothing will be spoiled going down those steps. I suppose I can't hope\n",
      "to be quite such a belle as if I had lived in those less-sophisticated\n",
      "days, but who knows? And I can forget Rosewater--and Bohemia; I sha'n't\n",
      "even think of the Stones until New Year's eve; I sent them their\n",
      "Christmas presents this morning, on purpose. I am going to be frivolous,\n",
      "coquette, and imagine myself a girl of the old Southern Set, when there\n",
      "were no new people. And I'm going to make them _think_ I am a great\n",
      "beauty, whether I am or not. I remember mamma used to say to me:\n",
      "'Cultivate the beauty air. That often is more effective than beauty\n",
      "itself. Tiny Montgomery was a beauty according to every known standard,\n",
      "but she had no dash, and was never looked at when Helena Belmont was in\n",
      "the room.' So to-night, you'll see me sail into that ballroom as if I\n",
      "already had the town at my feet. By-the-way--the last time I began to\n",
      "feel like a real girl again was that night at Arcot--and I did feel\n",
      "eighteen--triumphant--happy--until I got back and saw Lord Zeal in the\n",
      "library. I have never forgotten his face.\"\n",
      "\"Nor have I,\" said Gwynne, dryly; but he turned pale. \"I suppose you\n",
      "haven't had the least suspicion what he came to tell me that night?\"\n",
      "\"I thought to say good-bye without letting you know--it isn't possible\n",
      "that he told you he intended to kill himself?\"\n",
      "\"He told me a good deal more. He had shot Brathland. Murdered him, in\n",
      "plain English. You may fancy the night I had with him.\"\n",
      "Isabel stared up at him, the radiance gone from her face.\n",
      "\"And you have been carrying that about in addition to everything else?\"\n",
      "\"It was brutal to tell you this to-night! I can't imagine why I did,\n",
      "particularly as I have never told even my mother--who, like everybody\n",
      "else not necessarily in the secret, thinks that Zeal killed himself in\n",
      "despair over his failing health. But--yes, I remember that dress now--I\n",
      "rarely notice the details of women's clothes--but I remember admiring\n",
      "those blue lilies on that airy white stuff--I suppose you suddenly\n",
      "brought the whole thing back as vividly as if we were at Capheaton\n",
      "instead of out here on the edge of creation. You must forgive me and\n",
      "forget it.\"\n",
      "\"Yes I will! I'll forget everything for a week.\" She wheeled about and\n",
      "rubbed her cheeks. Gwynne stooped suddenly and kissed the little black\n",
      "mole on her shoulder.\n",
      "\"This is all I ask in return for the baubles,\" he murmured; and then as\n",
      "he met a blazing eye: \"Could I do less than restore your lovely color?\n",
      "But I must fly and get into my togs.\"\n",
      "XXXIII\n",
      "The old-fashioned interior of the Polk House, with, on the lower floor,\n",
      "its double parlors connected by sliding doors, its narrow central hall,\n",
      "and its many shapeless rooms of varying size, had been entirely\n",
      "remodelled by the essentially modern Mrs. Hofer. Her husband had wished\n",
      "to build an imposing mass of shingles and stones, but Mrs. Hofer was far\n",
      "too impatient to wait a year--perhaps two, if there were strikes--to\n",
      "take up her abode on Nob Hill, and the Polk House was in the market.\n",
      "Perhaps something in the stolid uncompromising exterior of the old\n",
      "barrack appealed to her irresistibly, mausoleum that it was of an\n",
      "aristocratic past. But upon the interior she wasted no sentiment, and\n",
      "some half a million of her husband's dollars. There were now three great\n",
      "rooms on the lower floor and four small ones, besides a circular hall\n",
      "with a spiral marble stair. The drawing-room, which ran from east to\n",
      "west, was one of the most notable rooms in the country, had been the\n",
      "subject of violent controversy, newspaper and verbal, and was a\n",
      "perpetual delight to the dramatic soul of its mistress. The most\n",
      "original artist the State had produced had painted a deep frieze which\n",
      "was a series of the strange moonlight scenes that had made his fame: the\n",
      "deep sulphurous blue of the California night sky, the long black\n",
      "shadows, the wind-driven trees, the low desolate adobe houses abandoned\n",
      "in the towns settled by Spain. Now and again a cluster of lights\n",
      "indicated a window-pane and a belated tenant, but the garden walls were\n",
      "in ruins, the tiled roofs sagging, the ancient whitewash was peeling;\n",
      "all blended and lifted into a harmony of color and pathos by the genius\n",
      "of the artist. The expanse of dull green-blue walls of rough plaster\n",
      "below the frieze was unbroken; on the marble floor there were blue\n",
      "velvet rugs. The furniture was of ebony and dull-blue brocade. There was\n",
      "not even a picture on an easel, but there were several Rodins and\n",
      "Meuniers. At the lower or west end of the room the wall had been removed\n",
      "and replaced by a single immense pane of plate glass. From this window,\n",
      "always curtainless, there was a startling view of the steep drop of the\n",
      "hill, beetling with houses and steeples, Telegraph Hill beyond and a\n",
      "little to the north; then the bay, and the towns on its opposite rim. At\n",
      "night the scene, with its blue above and black below, picked out with a\n",
      "thousand lights--massed into a diadem beyond the bay--looked like a\n",
      "sublimation of the painter's work. Within, the cunningly arranged lights\n",
      "saved the room at all times from being too sombre, and were set to\n",
      "reveal every detail of paintings far too precious to have been\n",
      "recklessly lavished upon a wooden house in the most recklessly built of\n",
      "all great cities.\n",
      "The dining-room--which had the proportions of a banqueting-hall, with an\n",
      "alcove for family use--was hung with tapestries and furnished with\n",
      "chairs lifted bodily from a castle in Spain; and it was a room in which\n",
      "no one would remember to look for ancestors. The library also commanded\n",
      "a view of the bay and had been decorated by native artists with\n",
      "imitations of the Giorgione frescoes, charmingly pink and smudgy. The\n",
      "hangings and furniture were of royal crimson brocade, and the walls were\n",
      "covered with books. Mr. Toole, who was a scholar of the old-fashioned\n",
      "sort, of which California still holds so many, had selected the books;\n",
      "and the contents were as noteworthy as the bindings. In a special alcove\n",
      "was a large number of priceless Fourteenth and Sixteenth Century\n",
      "editions. From this sumptuous room curved an iron balcony, where the old\n",
      "gentleman might be seen sunning himself any fine day, his steel\n",
      "spectacles half-way down his nose, and a volume propped on the shelf of\n",
      "an easy-chair furnished with all the modern improvements.\n",
      "On the white satin panels of the large round hall were a few of the most\n",
      "valuable old masters as yet brought to the country, but Mrs. Hofer, who\n",
      "was a patriot or nothing, did not hesitate to mix them with the best\n",
      "efforts of her fellow-citizens, nor to proclaim her preference for the\n",
      "native product. It was all very well to have old masters, and modern\n",
      "Europeans, if it was the thing, but she never felt quite at home with\n",
      "them, and liked her California inside as well as out.\n",
      "The four little reception-rooms, or boudoirs, were so many cabinets for\n",
      "treasures, and on the night of the ball, like the rest of the rooms on\n",
      "this floor, were entirely without further adornment; only the white\n",
      "marble of the spiral stair was festooned with crimson roses; and the\n",
      "narrow hall that led from the rotunda to the new ballroom was dressed in\n",
      "imitation of a long arbor of grape-vines, and hung with clusters of\n",
      "hot-house grapes and Chinese lanterns. The ballroom had been built out\n",
      "from the back of the house upon the steep drop of the hill, and as even\n",
      "its graduated foundation did not lift it to the level of the first\n",
      "floor, it was reached by a short flight of steps. For three months Mrs.\n",
      "Hofer's judicious hints had excited the curiosity of the town, and all\n",
      "that were not bedridden had presented themselves at as early an hour as\n",
      "self-respect would permit. Mrs. Hofer, to use her own phrase, had\n",
      "\"turned herself loose,\" on this room, and even her husband, who had\n",
      "gasped at the sum total, indulgent as he was, admitted to-night that\n",
      "\"she knew what she was about.\" The immense room was built to simulate a\n",
      "patio in Spain. The domed roof, in the blaze of light below, looked to\n",
      "be the dim blue vault of the night sky. The gallery that encircled the\n",
      "room was divided into balconies, and from them depended Gobelin\n",
      "tapestries, Eastern rugs, silken shawls--yellow embroidered with red,\n",
      "blue embroidered with white--after the manner of Spain on festa days.\n",
      "The background of the gallery was a mass of tropical plants alternating\n",
      "with latticed windows and long glass doors. Sitting with an arm or elbow\n",
      "on the railing, was every California woman of Mrs. Hofer's acquaintance\n",
      "that had the inherited right to wear a mantilla, a rose over her ear,\n",
      "and wield a large black fan; that is to say, those that were too old or\n",
      "too indifferent to dance. How Ada Hofer induced them to form a part of\n",
      "her decorations nobody ever knew, themselves least of all; but there, to\n",
      "the amazement and delight of the hundreds below, they were, and it was\n",
      "many years since the majority of them had looked so handsome. Beneath\n",
      "the balcony was an arcade where many seats were disposed among palms and\n",
      "pampas grass. The inevitable fountain was at the end of the room; it was\n",
      "of white stone, and colored lights played upon its foaming column. The\n",
      "musicians were in the gallery above it.\n",
      "When Gwynne and Isabel descended the steps and stood looking down upon\n",
      "the scene for a moment, the younger people were dancing. Every woman\n",
      "seemed to have been fired with the ambition to contribute her own part\n",
      "to the brilliancy of the night. There were tiaras by the score in these\n",
      "days, and the gowns had journeyed half-way round the world. There had\n",
      "been imported gowns in the immortal Eighties, when Mrs. Yorba reigned,\n",
      "but never a tiara; and Isabel for the first time fully realized the\n",
      "significant changes worked by the vast modern fortunes and their\n",
      "ambitious owners. Blood might have been enough for their predecessors,\n",
      "but the outward and visible sign for them.\n",
      "And all sets were represented to-night. It is doubtful if any woman had\n",
      "done as much to entice them to a common focus as the surmounting Mrs.\n",
      "Hofer. She was not the leader of San Francisco society, for that office\n",
      "was practically an elective one, and meant an infinite amount of trouble\n",
      "with corresponding perquisites; it must be held by a woman of supreme\n",
      "tact, experience, executive ability, and practically nothing else to do.\n",
      "The present incumbent, to the infinite credit of San Francisco, was a\n",
      "member of one of the oldest and most distinguished families in\n",
      "California; or in America, for that matter; and although still young,\n",
      "and with less to spend in a year than the Hofers wasted in a week, she\n",
      "had been chosen, after the death of the old leader, and some acrimonious\n",
      "discussion, to rule; and rule she did with a rod of iron. But she took\n",
      "her good where she found it, and was grateful for what Mrs. Hofer, with\n",
      "her beautiful house and irresistible energy had already accomplished.\n",
      "For Mrs. Hofer was by no means too democratic. If she had drawn all\n",
      "factions to her house she had taken care that only the best of her own\n",
      "kind came too, and this best was very good indeed; for it was educated\n",
      "and accomplished, more often than not had mingled in society abroad; an\n",
      "honor to which many of the ancient aristocracy had never aspired. No one\n",
      "recognized this fact, and the irresistible law of progress, better than\n",
      "the Leader, in spite of her Spanish blood; and to-night she sat in the\n",
      "very centre of the north gallery, her charming dark face draped in a\n",
      "mantilla some two centuries old. Beside her sat Anne Montgomery who had\n",
      "not a drop of Spanish in her, but whom Mrs. Hofer had done up with a\n",
      "brand-new mantilla of white lace and an immense black fan. Miss\n",
      "Montgomery had a lingering sense of humor, but it suited her to look\n",
      "young and pretty once more, if only for a night. Mrs. Trennahan, who was\n",
      "really fond of Mrs. Hofer, particularly as she had been adroitly\n",
      "persuaded that this party was to be a mere setting for her lovely young\n",
      "daughter, also decorated the gallery in one of the old Yorba\n",
      "mantillas--it had belonged to the beautiful aunt for whom this house had\n",
      "been built by the husband she scorned--and wore it for the first time in\n",
      "her life. Trennahan had shaken with a fit of inward laughter, but had\n",
      "compelled his eyes to express only admiration and approval.\n",
      "Other dowagers sat below, some bediamonded and others not: the \"old\n",
      "Southern Set\" lived on diminishing incomes; new industries were\n",
      "decreasing the values of the old. They had lost none of their pride, but\n",
      "philosophy had mellowed them, and they were honestly grateful for such\n",
      "splendid diversion; and Mrs. Hofer's suppers cost a small fortune, even\n",
      "in San Francisco. Their offspring cared as little for traditions as for\n",
      "supper, and had married or were marrying into the newer sets, rapidly\n",
      "obliterating what lines were left. As for the new, they were legion, and\n",
      "not to be distinguished by the casual eye from those that traced their\n",
      "descent to the crumbling mansions of South Park and Rincon Hill; and\n",
      "they had the earnest co-operation of the best of the world's milliners.\n",
      "The pick of Bohemia was also present, those that were distinguishing\n",
      "themselves in art and letters, or even on the stage, for Mrs. Hofer had\n",
      "learned some of her lessons in London. All that were now looked upon as\n",
      "county families, spending as they did but one or two months of the year\n",
      "in the city, had come to town for this ball, but the country towns were\n",
      "represented only by Gwynne and Isabel and the Tom Coltons. The group of\n",
      "men so desperately interested in the municipal affairs of the city\n",
      "disliked and distrusted Colton; but Mrs. Leslie had been born on Rincon\n",
      "Hill, and all doors, old and new, were open to her daughter. Isabel\n",
      "caught a glimpse of Anabel among the dancers, in a gown of primrose\n",
      "satin almost the color of her hair, and a little diamond tiara made from\n",
      "some old stones of her mother's.\n",
      "\"Well!\" exclaimed Isabel. \"What do you think of us? Is it not a\n",
      "wonderful scene?\"\n",
      "Gwynne nodded. \"All that is wanting is a background of caballeros in the\n",
      "gallery, silk and ruffles, and hair tied with ribbons. But I suppose the\n",
      "old gentlemen objected. There must be some limit to Mrs. Hofer's powers\n",
      "of persuasion. But--yes--it is a wonderful scene, and you are a\n",
      "wonderful people to take so much trouble.\"\n",
      "The waltz finished and Mrs. Hofer bore down upon them. She wore white\n",
      "brocade, the flowers outlined with jewels, shimmering under a cloud of\n",
      "tulle, and her neck and her fashionably dressed head were hardly to be\n",
      "seen for the rubies and diamonds that bound them. She was fairly\n",
      "palpitating with youth and triumph, and delight in the dance, and\n",
      "although without beauty or a patrician outline, there was no more\n",
      "radiant vision in the room. She reproached Isabel for being late,\n",
      "informed her that she had ordered all the best men to keep dances for\n",
      "her, summoned several, and then bore off Gwynne to introduce him to the\n",
      "prettiest of the girls. In a few moments Isabel was engaged for every\n",
      "dance before supper; she had given the _cotillon_ to Gwynne.\n",
      "She had realized immediately, that upon such a scene, with such a\n",
      "background, she could hope to make no such overwhelming impression as\n",
      "had fallen to the lot of Helena Belmont; surrounded by buff-colored\n",
      "walls and a small exclusive society--for the most part disdainful of\n",
      "dress. Nevertheless, she was soon pleasurably aware that she was the\n",
      "subject of much comment, not only in the gallery, but among the hundreds\n",
      "of smart young girls and women on the floor, the men that danced, and\n",
      "those that supported the walls. The old beaux, left over from the days\n",
      "when Nina Randolph and Guadalupe Hathaway had reigned, who had put the\n",
      "stamp of an almost incoherent approval upon the dazzling Helena, that\n",
      "famous night of her debut, were dead and dust; but another group,\n",
      "including the quartet that had as promptly declared themselves the\n",
      "suitors and slaves of the exacting beauty, were present to-night,\n",
      "critically regarding the debutantes. Their comparisons were less\n",
      "impassioned than those of their old mentors, for they were tired; they\n",
      "had disposed of much of their superfluous enthusiasm in the increased\n",
      "difficulties of making an income, since the brief reign of a heartless\n",
      "witch, whom they still remembered with an occasional pang of sentiment,\n",
      "but more gratitude that they had not had her as well as fortune to\n",
      "subdue. None had prospered exceedingly, but all had done well. They were\n",
      "still in their forties, but as gray as their fathers had been at sixty;\n",
      "indeed, looked older than Trennahan, who had disdained to add to his own\n",
      "and his wife's fortunes, and lived merely to enjoy life; and they would\n",
      "far rather have been in bed. But three of them were indulgent family\n",
      "men. Eugene Fort had clung to the single state, but the others were\n",
      "contributing one or more daughters to the evening's entertainment; and\n",
      "they had all drifted naturally together to discuss the new beauties\n",
      "before retreating to the haven at the top of the house where there was a\n",
      "billiard-table and much good whiskey and tobacco. They were disputing\n",
      "over the respective claims of Inez Trennahan, who was a replica of the\n",
      "California _Favoritas_ of a century ago, and Catalina Over with the\n",
      "Indian blood on her high cheek-bones, and her mouth like an Indian's\n",
      "bow, when Isabel descended the stairs. They promptly gave her the palm,\n",
      "although they did not turn pale, nor lose their breath.\n",
      "\"The grand style,\" said Trennahan. \"I wonder will the home-bred youth\n",
      "appreciate it? In your day she would have had a better chance, but most\n",
      "of these worthy young men, when they have been to college at all, have\n",
      "patronized Stanford or Berkeley; in other words, never been out of the\n",
      "State, and, no doubt, prefer the more vivid, frivolous, and essentially\n",
      "modern product.\"\n",
      "\"If it lay with us,\" said Alan Rush, sadly. \"But it is as you say. She\n",
      "will frighten most of the young fellows. By Jove, she looks as if she\n",
      "had danced at Washington's first ball. But that's it. Nothing free and\n",
      "easy, there. It's no longer the fashion to be too aristocratic.\"\n",
      "But Isabel, if she did not create a _furore_ among the young men, who\n",
      "would have thought such a performance beneath their dignity, was, at\n",
      "least, generally admitted to be \"Pretty well as stunning a girl as you\n",
      "might see in a long day's journey,\" \"a regular ripper,\" \"the handsomest\n",
      "of the bunch,\" and as far as \"mere looks went\" the \"pick of the lot.\"\n",
      "The girls viewed her with no great favor, but the majority of the women,\n",
      "especially those in the galleries, sustained the verdict of the men; and\n",
      "the Leader, in the course of the evening, descended and introduced\n",
      "herself, claimed relationship, and graciously intimated that if Isabel\n",
      "cared to join the _cotillon_ clubs and the skating-rink--_The_\n",
      "skating-rink--an exclusive yet hospitable wing would be lifted. A\n",
      "younger brother of Mr. Hofer, who had also multiplied his paternal\n",
      "million, devoted himself to her seriously, and Gwynne, who soon had\n",
      "enough of dancing, gracefully renounced his claims to the german. They\n",
      "had one waltz together and then he did not see her again until the hour\n",
      "of departure, when he stood in the hall and watched her descend the\n",
      "winding white stair between the roses. He thought her a charming picture\n",
      "in her long white coat, with a lace scarf over her head, and her arms\n",
      "full of costly toys. When she reached his side she ordered him to put\n",
      "her favors into the pockets of his overcoat, and keep his hand on his\n",
      "pistol, as she would not risk losing one of them, much less her jewels.\n",
      "Her eyes were very bright, and her cheeks deeply flushed, but were the\n",
      "cause a fully satisfied ambition, he could only guess.\n",
      "XXXIV\n",
      "The hour was four, and after they had said their last good-night to the\n",
      "guests whose homes lay between the Hofer mansion and their own, they met\n",
      "but one foot passenger as belated as themselves. This was a big man that\n",
      "loomed suddenly out of the fog. Isabel screamed and ran into the middle\n",
      "of the street, and Gwynne, who had obediently taken out his pistol, half\n",
      "raised it. But the man laughed.\n",
      "\"I'm on the lookout for thim meself,\" he said, in a rich brogue. \"Good\n",
      "luck to yees.\"\n",
      "As they let themselves into the house, Gwynne threw his hat and coat on\n",
      "the settle in the vestibule, and then ran his hand through his hair and\n",
      "rubbed the back of his head, a habit of his when he had a suggestion to\n",
      "make.\n",
      "\"I remember we were going to sit up the rest of that night--or\n",
      "morning--after Arcot,\" he said. \"Are you very tired?\"\n",
      "\"Tired? I shall not sleep a wink for hours. The fire is sure to be laid\n",
      "in the tower-room.\"\n",
      "They went into the small circular room, furnished in several shades of\n",
      "green, that Isabel had retained for her own use, and while she shook\n",
      "down her skirts Gwynne applied a match to the coals. The raw morning air\n",
      "had penetrated the house, too old-fashioned to have a furnace, but\n",
      "wooden walls are quickly heated. When Gwynne had removed the blower\n",
      "several times and satisfied himself that the hard coals would burn, he\n",
      "resumed the perpendicular.\n",
      "He looked doubtfully at Isabel, who was still wrapped in her cloak, and\n",
      "had elevated her feet, covered with the long carriage-boots, to the\n",
      "fender. \"Sha'n't you take off those things?\" he asked. \"You don't look\n",
      "as if you meant to stay.\"\n",
      "\"You can take off the boots, but I'll keep on my coat for a few\n",
      "moments.\"\n",
      "He laughed as he knelt again. \"I certainly am getting broken in. I have\n",
      "known Englishwomen to pull off their husband's hunting-boots after a\n",
      "hard day's work--\"\n",
      "\"The idea!\"\n",
      "\"Very good idea. Do you mean that you would not?\"\n",
      "\"Well, I might, as a return favor. You need not take all night to pull\n",
      "off mine.\"\n",
      "\"You might, at least, let virtue be its own reward. It's not often it\n",
      "has the chance.\"\n",
      "\"Well, get up and don't be an idiot. I suppose you have been flirting in\n",
      "the conservatory all the evening and haven't had time to readjust your\n",
      "mood.\"\n",
      "\"Mrs. Hofer has no conservatory. Great oversight. But I did sit out a\n",
      "dance or two in that room with the immense window--\"\n",
      "\"With whom?\"\n",
      "\"I have forgotten her name. Will you have a cigarette?\"\n",
      "\"No, but you may smoke if you like.\"\n",
      "He had settled himself in a deep chair on the opposite side of the\n",
      "hearth. There was a silence of nearly ten minutes, until Isabel,\n",
      "suddenly removing her coat, brought Gwynne out of his reverie.\n",
      "\"I cannot say that to-night was in any sense a repetition of my own\n",
      "experience at Arcot,\" he said, abruptly. \"That night--I have tried to\n",
      "forget it--I had enough adulation to turn any man's head. I fancy it\n",
      "_was_ pretty well turned, and that made the wrench during the small\n",
      "hours the more severe. Still, it has been an interesting evening, and\n",
      "one or two things happened.\"\n",
      "\"What?\" Isabel was full of her own experiences, but too much of a woman\n",
      "to betray the fact when a man wanted to talk about himself.\n",
      "\"I danced for a while, but I had had exercise enough during the day, and\n",
      "didn't care particularly about it. Besides, all the girls I danced with,\n",
      "and that one I sat up-stairs with for a few minutes, not only talked my\n",
      "head off, but quizzed me, and I did not understand it. To my amazement,\n",
      "I learned not long after that they know who I am. Can you imagine how it\n",
      "got out?\"\n",
      "\"They know everything. It is an old saying that the San Francisco girls\n",
      "scent a stranger the moment he leaves the tram at the Oakland mole, and\n",
      "know all about him before he has registered. The obscurest knight could\n",
      "not hide himself in this town. Rosewater alone saved you so long. How\n",
      "did they quiz you?\"\n",
      "\"Each began at once to talk about my 'distinguished relative, Elton\n",
      "Gwynne.' I may be more dense than most, or perhaps I was merely bored,\n",
      "but I assumed that they thought I was his brother and knew his\n",
      "whereabouts. When supper was half over, and I was congratulating myself\n",
      "that I had got out of the _cotillon_, even with you, for it meant\n",
      "dancing with a lot of others, my host took me firmly by the arm and\n",
      "marched me up-stairs. He informed me that he was 'bored stiff,' could\n",
      "see that I was, and had 'coralled' a few more choice spirits. We went,\n",
      "not to the smoking or billiard-room, but to his own bedroom, and here I\n",
      "found four or five more of your strenuous millionaires, the reform\n",
      "editor, and the lawyer that looks like a bull-dog waiting for the word\n",
      "to spring at the throat of the Boss and his whole vile crew.\n",
      "\"Here we sat and smoked until the air inside was as thick as the fog\n",
      "that blotted out the lights of the city and towns opposite. Of course\n",
      "the talk was of the rotten state of San Francisco. I never heard the\n",
      "whole story before, and it made my hair stand on end. I knew that vice\n",
      "flaunted itself more openly here than elsewhere, but I did not guess\n",
      "that the thousand and one establishments of every sort, from the lowest\n",
      "negro dive under the sidewalk, and the snares for the very young of both\n",
      "sexes, straight up to the most gaudy 'French restaurants,' as well as\n",
      "Chinatown, Barbary coast, and all the rest, paid tribute to the gang of\n",
      "political ruffians that have got control of the city. No wonder the last\n",
      "have developed a preternatural sharpness that makes it next to\n",
      "impossible to bring the charges home, for they will all be rich enough\n",
      "in time to move to Europe and buy up such salable scions of\n",
      "improverished houses as happen to be on the market. The thing is as well\n",
      "known as I know that you are my third cousin, but, although the\n",
      "second-rate grafters are brazen enough, it is not worth while to attack\n",
      "them until the Boss is done for, and so far he has proved much too\n",
      "clever to be caught. A college man, although of low origin, and an\n",
      "accomplished lawyer of a sort, he pockets huge sums from these\n",
      "disreputable establishments, for himself and his minion, the mayor, and\n",
      "calls them attorney's fees. Naturally the panderers to vice won't admit\n",
      "they are blackmailed: they are between the devil and the deep sea; if\n",
      "the fight came on in earnest, and they gave evidence against the Boss,\n",
      "and the Boss won, he would clean them all out and put others in. The\n",
      "Reformers, if they won, would clean them out too; so, naturally, they\n",
      "hold their tongues and hope this reform movement will peter out as so\n",
      "many others have done. So do the Board of Supervisors whom the Boss also\n",
      "owns and through whom he blackmails the great corporations. But--and\n",
      "when they had got to this point in the talk there was an abrupt pause,\n",
      "and then Hofer turned to me and said: 'Even if you don't come in and\n",
      "join us, which I always hope you will do, I know a man that can keep his\n",
      "mouth shut when I see him. So fire away.'\n",
      "\"And then they discussed the fact that one of their number had recently\n",
      "gone to Washington to ask the President to send out an able man of the\n",
      "Government Secret Service; they have every reason to believe that this\n",
      "request will be complied with. With sufficient evidence they would then\n",
      "make a quiet crusade in the hope of rousing public spirit to the extent\n",
      "of forcing in a grand jury that could not be bought by the Boss.\n",
      "Needless to say he has controlled every grand jury that has met during\n",
      "his reign, and one might as well hope to convict a wind for unroofing a\n",
      "house, even were he not master of every legal trick himself, and had he\n",
      "taken less pains to cover up his tracks. In this detective lies their\n",
      "chief hope at present; but what a slender hope it is, when you consider\n",
      "the devil-may-care character of these San Franciscans, who would dance\n",
      "on the edge of hell, with equal nonchalance, if only there were a screen\n",
      "between. There is not an outstanding excuse for forming a vigilance\n",
      "committee, as there was during the Dennis Kearney-Anti-Chinese riots of\n",
      "1879, and there is no such aroused public spirit and indignation as\n",
      "sustained the Vigilantes of the Fifties. These rascals take good care to\n",
      "be non-sensational in their methods, and what the San Franciscan doesn't\n",
      "see doesn't worry him. The city is rich, prosperous, famous, tourists\n",
      "are pouring in, the best in drama and opera comes yearly--to be\n",
      "presented in fire-traps whose owners pay toll to the Boss; they already\n",
      "have the handsomest hotels in the world, the finest cooking, climate;\n",
      "even earthquakes--severe ones--have moved elsewhere. What can you do\n",

      "\"So am I! I have an idea you won't. You are quite different from all\n",

      "frivolous, the most feminine and the most modern, the most daring and\n",
      "the most indifferent, I have ever met. Those that have been as carefully\n",

      "\"Yes, but of a very exclusive sort--to say nothing of the peculiar\n",
      "circumstances that were bound to breed seriousness of mind. And you have\n",
      "quite a distinguished collection of real ancestors, and intellect\n",
      "instead of mere cleverness. It is only once in a while that your--let me\n",
      "whisper it--Western frankness and ingenuousness leap out--the\n",
      "impulsiveness, the electric passion. When a certain amount of\n",

      "She wrapped herself in her cloak once more, and they climbed to the\n",
      "crest of the hill and watched the sun rise behind the Berkeley mountains\n",
      "and bathe San Francisco in trembling fire. It routed what was left of\n",
      "the fog, although for a time the walls and waters of the Golden Gate\n",
      "looked darker than before, and Tamalpais was a mountain of onyx. In a\n",
      "few moments the smoke that wrapped the San Francisco day in a brown\n",
      "perpetual haze began to ascend first from the little chimneys and then\n",
      "from the great stacks. But until then every steeple, every tower, the\n",
      "great piles of stone and brick in the valley, the old gardens full of\n",
      "eucalyptus-trees and weeping willows, the strange assortment of\n",
      "architectures on Nob Hill, even the rows of houses on the tapering\n",
      "half-circle of hills beyond the valley, miles away, stood out as bright\n",
      "and sharp and shadowless as if caught and imprisoned in a crystal ball.\n",
      "It was the drifting smoke that seemed to bind all together and make the\n",
      "city fit for humanity.\n",
      "Gwynne pointed to a spot far to the southeast, in the valley between\n",

      "make us rich. Half is practically sold, and the proceeds, and the money\n",
      "raised on the other half, will erect a building that is to cost some two\n",
      "hundred thousand dollars. The insurance rates will be enormous, but even\n",
      "so the income should be really a great one. If all goes well, the\n",
      "foundations--of reinforced concrete, although they still laugh at\n",
      "earthquakes--but Mr. Colton is a monster of caution--will be laid in\n",

      "\"That means the beginnings of a millionaire. Do you really care so much\n",
      "to be rich?\"\n",
      "\"I know the value of money,\" said Gwynne, dryly. \"I have no intention of\n",
      "buying men after the fashion of your friend Tom Colton, but it is a\n",

      "Miss Montgomery called as Isabel and Gwynne were sitting down to\n",

      "renewed her youth briefly the night before, her old admirers had shown\n",
      "her much gallant attention, and if she had gone home with a song in her\n",
      "heart and a flame in her eyes, she had been but the more conscious of\n",
      "the wooden spoon upon awakening. She had risen with no very keen regret\n",
      "for her vanished claims upon men long since married and consoled, for\n",
      "she had never been what is called a marrying girl, but with her mind\n",
      "inclined to gloomy meditation upon lost opportunities far more dear. She\n",
      "had never ceased to believe that, the fates conspiring, she might have\n",
      "become one of the great musicians of the world; for although she was\n",
      "willing to admit the defect of will that had reduced her to the ranks,\n",
      "she had not grasped the historic fact that the born artist accomplishes\n",
      "his fulfilment in spite of all obstacles, imagined or real. Her\n",
      "obstacles had been purely sentimental, for her family were commonplace\n",
      "selfish people not worth considering, and, her endowment being just\n",
      "short of distinguished, a misplaced sense of duty and the stultifying\n",
      "influences of her home were responsible for her profession as caterer at\n",
      "the age of thirty-six. Her people had belonged to the type that held in\n",
      "aristocratic disgust the \"woman who did things,\" \"showed herself to the\n",
      "public\"; moreover, as Isabel had told Gwynne, they worshipped the\n",
      "flower-like artistic young creature, and would let neither the world nor\n",
      "man have aught of her. She was twenty-eight when her family died, and\n",
      "knowing that as a music-teacher she could not hope to compete with\n",
      "finished instructors, she had looked ever her other talents and found\n",
      "that the only one which promised immediate returns was a certain knack\n",
      "for sauces and sweets. All her friends rushed to her assistance, and\n",
      "while broiling over a hot stove, stirring jam, wished that dear Anne\n",
      "were not so proud and would accept a check without any fuss. But Miss\n",
      "Montgomery quickly graduated from this amateur stage. She set herself\n",
      "deliberately to work to become a _chef_, and, from offerings to the\n",
      "Womans' Exchange, she was soon supplying choice dishes for luncheons,\n",
      "and finally entire dinners. She had a warm friend in the then Leader of\n",
      "San Francisco Society, and her own cleverness and indomitable\n",
      "perseverance did the rest. She sometimes reflected that if she had found\n",
      "the iron in her nature sooner she might have been fiddling in Vienna;\n",
      "but perhaps her highest gift had really been culinary, perhaps she\n",
      "needed the enthusiastic encouragement which she found on all sides when\n",
      "she embraced that appealing art; at all events she succeeded, was\n",
      "educating a promising orphan relative, and laying by for her old age.\n",
      "Another friend, no doubt, was the massive family silver which had\n",
      "escaped the wreck. Many of the new people, Mrs. Hofer among others, did\n",
      "not care for the responsibility of a luxury so tempting to thieves, and\n",
      "for which they had no innate predilection; they were more than willing\n",
      "to pay a reasonable sum for ancestral decorations upon state occasions,\n",
      "and to dine from artistic plated ware meanwhiles. Not but that there\n",
      "was a sufficiency of solid bullion to be seen on many a San Francisco\n",
      "table, and there were several golden services in the city; but rich\n",
      "people have all sorts of economical kinks, and Miss Montgomery found\n",
      "this one profitable. Another thing, no doubt, that had contributed to\n",
      "her success, was the business-like attitude she had assumed as soon as\n",
      "she felt herself a professional. She accompanied her refections to the\n",
      "kitchen door, although the front was always open to her, and\n",
      "philosophically pocketed the customary tip.\n",
      "And she had struggled valiantly against becoming an embittered old maid;\n",
      "in the main, had succeeded. To the world, at least, she rarely turned a\n",
      "scowl, and she had never lost a friend. But there were times when she\n",
      "hated her parents. Since Isabel's return she had had more than one\n",
      "rebellious hour, for Isabel had taken her life in both hands, snapped\n",
      "her fingers at restraints and small conventions, and, so far, at least,\n",
      "had made good. And the younger girl's development, to one that had known\n",
      "her always, was extraordinary. On the other hand, she exulted in the\n",
      "prospect of a member of the old set coming prominently to the front once\n",
      "more. She had spent a week with Isabel at Old Inn, and received a\n",
      "certain measure of confidence. She hoped that Isabel would really make a\n",
      "fortune, and urged her to follow Gwynne's example and put up a modern\n",
      "building on her San Francisco property. Money was easy to raise, for\n",
      "change and improvement possessed San Franciscans like an epidemic, and\n",
      "few but were not anxious to convert \"South of Market Street\" into a\n",
      "great business district. Although she was grateful to the new people,\n",
      "particularly Ada Hofer, who, to use the lady's own expression \"made\n",
      "things hum,\" in her heart she disliked the breed, and deeply resented\n",
      "the fact that the old set, even those by no means impoverished, to-day\n",
      "formed little more than a background. They were to be seen everywhere,\n",
      "they were still a power in a way, but they were by no means prosilient.\n",
      "Therefore, as she sat in the old dark dining-room on Russian Hill and\n",
      "listened to Isabel's praise of the interest that Hofer and his set took\n",
      "in the political and artistic regeneration of the city, she was moved to\n",
      "break out tartly:\n",
      "\"Are you giving them credit for altruism? They have their millions\n",
      "invested here, naturally they crave a reasonable prospect of retaining\n",
      "them--also of increasing them by filling Fairmont, and other projected\n",
      "caravansaries for the rich, with winter tourists from the East; possibly\n",
      "Europe. They not only fear the corporation cormorants--whom they can\n",
      "never reach so long as the Board of Supervisors is controlled by the\n",
      "Boss--the Boss himself and all his devouring horde, but the greatest\n",
      "menace of all: that San Francisco will in time, and before very long, be\n",
      "owned body and soul by the labor-unions. Then, even if they managed to\n",
      "save their wealth, the city would be intolerable for the socially\n",
      "ambitious or even the merely refined.\"\n",
      "\"You are unfair,\" said Gwynne; \"for these men all have enough to pull\n",
      "out and invest elsewhere. They could go to New York and buy a big\n",
      "position, as so many of their predecessors have done. Or to London. Of\n",
      "course no man ever lived that was wholly disinterested, unless he was a\n",
      "fanatic, but it is vastly to the credit of these men that they love\n",
      "their own city, stand by it--determined to make it livable, not only for\n",
      "themselves, but for future generations; instead of moving away and\n",
      "becoming millionaires of leisure.\"\n",
      "\"Oh yes, I don't deny that they have enthusiasm--the remnant, no doubt,\n",
      "of what in their European ancestors was temperament. Americans don't\n",
      "have temperament. Or if we have we are far too self-conscious to show\n",
      "it. In the East it has been quite eradicated. Out here where gambling is\n",
      "still in the blood--and that blood is mixed--where the air is full of\n",
      "electricity, and the very ground under your feet none too certain, we\n",
      "are a little more primitive; we have an excitability that makes\n",
      "strangers find us more like the Latin races of Europe than our relatives\n",
      "beyond the Rockies. And although the set you admire does not drink, nor\n",
      "live the all-night life, it has its own demands for spice and variety,\n",
      "and its own ways of gratifying them. Love of change, love of any sort of\n",
      "a fight, is in the blood of your true Californian--particularly here in\n",
      "San Francisco, where all the great gambling fevers, from the days of '49\n",
      "to the wild speculations in Virginia City stocks in '76, have raged up\n",
      "and out. Your friends are merely playing a big game. Successive defeats,\n",
      "and the formidable front of the enemy, make it the more stimulating.\n",
      "They have that fanatical love of San Francisco that every one out here\n",
      "has who doesn't hate it, and they find it more exciting to stay here and\n",
      "gamble for big stakes than to watch their wives spend money in New York,\n",
      "and console them for snubs. Another point--they are far more\n",
      "enterprising than the rich men's sons that preceded this generation--or\n",
      "set, rather. They keep on making money, you may have observed. And\n",
      "fashions change. New York Society is no longer the Mecca of the worldly\n",
      "San Franciscan, and it has also become the fashion to invest huge\n",
      "amounts here; in many cases, entire fortunes. These men really could not\n",
      "pull out without great loss of income, and they all know how safe it is\n",
      "to leave one's interests in other people's hands. In this town, at\n",
      "least, no one has ever done that without regretting it.\"\n",
      "\"If the fashion has changed I dare say it is these men that have changed\n",
      "it. I always bow to feminine logic, but nothing you have said so far has\n",
      "changed my attitude. Besides, I admire their taste. This is the only\n",
      "part of America that has made any appeal to me, and there is no question\n",
      "that if they force through the Burnham plans, this city, with its\n",
      "wonderful natural advantages, will be as beautiful as ancient Athens.\n",
      "Surely you must admit ideality in men that can conceive such an ideal\n",
      "and cling to it, no matter how forlorn the hope.\"\n",
      "\"That's just what I object to. The least imaginative of us realizes that\n",
      "nature gave San Francisco a beautiful face and that man has done all he\n",
      "could to scar it. But even did these men obtain control--which they\n",
      "can't short of lynch law--it would take half a century to remove the old\n",
      "city piecemeal. Do you imagine property-owners are going to change their\n",
      "natures and sacrifice profitable office buildings and shops for the sake\n",
      "of widening streets and making boulevards and parks? Do you realize what\n",
      "it would mean in the way of individual sacrifice to build winding roads\n",
      "about these hills instead of the improved and perpendicular gullies we\n",
      "have to-day? Not even your own would do it. They merely dream and talk,\n",
      "although, no doubt, they would make all the changes that promised large\n",
      "personal profits. I suspect that the secret of their zeal is the desire\n",
      "to deflect the tourist tide from south to north.\"\n",
      "Gwynne laughed. He was a stubborn idealist, and having found something\n",
      "at last to admire he purposed to hug it. \"You belong to the pessimistic\n",
      "camp. I discovered that when you honored Old Inn. And I have lived here\n",
      "long enough to learn that it is full enough. But you are all different\n",
      "from other Americans, and for that reason I find the most discontented\n",
      "of you interesting.\"\n",
      "But Miss Montgomery suspected that he was quizzing her and would not be\n",
      "drawn further. Instead, she proposed a walk, and Gwynne in his turn\n",
      "suggested that they go over and look at his property, which he had\n",
      "visited once only. Miss Montgomery knew the history of every house old\n",
      "and new, and told them many anecdotes as they walked down the steep\n",
      "hills or along the cross streets to Kearney, at the base. The new houses\n",
      "had fine gardens, the old ones were gloomy with eucalypti, or ragged\n",
      "with palms, but everywhere were flowers, even at this season, giving an\n",
      "immediate relief to the eye from the long dull perspective. On six days\n",
      "out of the seven the streets were torn with wind when they were not\n",
      "drenched with rain, and in the dry season the dust was intolerable;\n",
      "although San Franciscans vowed it was a part of the picture and missed\n",
      "it when abroad. But gay as certain sections of San Francisco was at\n",
      "night, its residence districts always had a deserted air, and on Sunday\n",
      "nothing could exceed the brown desolation of the shopping streets. From\n",
      "a variety of causes San Franciscans were averse from too much\n",
      "pedestrianism, and one could walk for blocks and pass nothing but an\n",
      "occasional carriage, or the trolley-cars shrieking up and down the\n",
      "hills, or emptying themselves into Kearney and Montgomery streets with\n",
      "the racket of a besieging army.\n",
      "But this Christmas Day it was clear and warm, and the wind drifted about\n",
      "as if its wings were tired. All the world was on the cable and trolley\n",
      "cars, but bound for park and sea, and in the opposite direction from the\n",
      "three on their way to the valley south of Market Street. Kearney Street\n",
      "would have looked like a necropolis had it not been for several patient\n",
      "horses standing with their feet on the pavement, their ears cocked\n",
      "towards a saloon, or establishment for \"rifle practice\"; and even Market\n",
      "Street, on week-days barely passable with its trucks, four lines of\n",
      "cars, and a mass of humanity, was almost deserted. They walked past the\n",
      "Palace Hotel, down Second Street, and by many dingy peeling low-browed\n",
      "and entirely hideous shops and flats, with glimpses into unsavory cross\n",
      "streets, until they came to the block owned by the Otises since the\n",
      "early Fifties. Even in its present condition the rents were\n",
      "considerable, and as it was but a stone's-throw from several other new\n",
      "office buildings, there was no question that in the course of a few\n",
      "years the land value would be doubled, and Gwynne regretted being forced\n",
      "to sell a portion of his share in order to be able to erect a building\n",
      "large enough to pay. What was left of Hiram Otis's portion, inherited by\n",
      "Isabel, stood on the opposite corner, and now yielded only ground rent,\n",
      "the old buildings having crumbled on the stock-market. But the land\n",
      "could be sold conditionally, and once more Miss Montgomery suggested\n",
      "building. Gwynne turned to Isabel with interest.\n",
      "\"Do!\" he exclaimed. \"Come in with us, and we'll put up a larger\n",
      "building. Sell your land and I'll borrow money on one of the ranches,\n",
      "and sell out my Consols. Then I can hold on to all this, and we'll none\n",
      "of us have so long to wait for large returns.\"\n",
      "\"I am afraid of fires,\" said Isabel, dubiously. \"The most vivid memories\n",
      "of my childhood are standing at my window on the Hill in my night-gown\n",
      "and watching whole blocks down here in flames. The wonder is that yours\n",
      "have never gone. Now I get my ground rent, no matter what happens.\" But\n",
      "before she had finished speaking she had made a sudden movement towards\n",
      "Gwynne. \"I will do it,\" she said. \"It will be better--all round.\"\n",
      "\"Good! And I intend to put on outside shutters of asbestos, so, with\n",
      "walls of concrete and steel, and as little wood inside as possible, we\n",
      "should weather anything short of subterranean fires.\"\n",
      "Then Miss Montgomery took them through South Park, the oval enclosure,\n",
      "surrounded by high brown sad-looking houses looking down upon a bit of\n",
      "dusty green, and pointed out the long-deserted mansions of the\n",
      "Randolphs, the Hathaways, the Hunt McLanes, and of others who had\n",
      "dispensed the simple lavish hospitality of the Fifties and Sixties. She\n",
      "was intensely proud of the fact that her mother had been born in South\n",
      "Park, and pointed with a sigh, not all unconscious affectation, to the\n",
      "stiff three-storied house that had come, with so many others, \"round the\n",
      "Horn\" in the Fifties. Beside it, looking like an old man with his arms\n",
      "hanging and his jaw fallen, its windows vacant and broken, its paint\n",
      "long unrenewed, and cobwebs on the very doorstep, stood the Randolph\n",
      "House, the theatre of the most poignant of all an Francisco's initial\n",
      "tragedies. Isabel had told Gwynne the story of Nina Randolph, and as\n",
      "Anne repeated it he recalled the name of Dudley Thorpe, and remembered\n",
      "that he had left the reputation of a good parliamentarian and M. F. H.\n",
      "They went up to Rincon Hill, once the haughty elder sister of South\n",
      "Park, now looking like a lonely island in a dirty sea covered with\n",
      "wreckage. There still remained several handsome old ivy-covered\n",
      "mansions, and many beautiful as well as picturesquely dilapidated\n",
      "gardens. Rincon Hill had contributed two peeresses to England, Lee\n",
      "Tarlton and Tiny Montgomery, and Gwynne not only knew them both, but was\n",
      "the more interested, as Cecil Maundrell's sudden elevation to the\n",
      "earldom of Barnstaple during his active youth had served as an\n",
      "object-lesson to himself. Mrs. Montgomery's old home was in good repair,\n",
      "but she was in Europe as usual, and Randolph Montgomery, now in the\n",
      "diplomatic service--too independent for the machine, he had been driven\n",
      "out of politics some years since--preferred the more central comforts of\n",
      "a hotel when he visited San Francisco. Two old family servants were\n",
      "sunning themselves in the garden. The window-curtains were presumably\n",
      "packed in camphor, and the dim panes suggested a cobwebbed and desolate\n",
      "interior. Gwynne glanced across the ugly shabby but teeming valley to\n",
      "the symbols of stupendous energies concentrated on its edge, and the\n",
      "variegated magnificence of the hills, piling like roughly terraced\n",
      "cliffs above it; then west to the mountains by the sea, green, unclaimed\n",
      "by man as yet, although the dead were thick on the hills just below. It\n",
      "was a city struggling out of chaos, but perhaps more interesting than it\n",
      "would be a century hence, when it had fulfilled its destiny and become a\n",
      "great metropolis of white marble and stone. A century? Nowhere had era\n",
      "succeeded era with such startling rapidity, nowhere in one short\n",
      "half-century had the genus American passed through so many phases. The\n",
      "evidences were all before him. Once again he had the impression of\n",
      "standing in the presence of hoary age--ugly premature age--was that the\n",
      "secret of the vague suggestion of an unthinkable antiquity that so often\n",
      "rose like a ghost in his mind?\n",
      "The girls announced that they should ride back, and they walked over and\n",
      "took a Third Street car. It was almost empty when they entered, but was\n",
      "invaded at the next corner by a belated pleasure party bound for the\n",
      "Park, a noisy disreputable crowd of flashy men, and girls with bold\n",
      "tired eyes, a thick coat of the white paint which has made the fortune\n",
      "of the San Francisco chemist, and gaudy cheap attire. Known in the\n",
      "vernacular as \"chippies,\" they bore a crude Western resemblance to the\n",
      "Parisian grisette, and what they lacked in style they made up in sound.\n",
      "They were the class that monopolized boats and trains on Sundays,\n",
      "screaming steadily through the tunnels, and returned late, no longer\n",
      "happy because no longer able to make a noise. One of the young women\n",
      "pointed a finger at Gwynne, screaming, \"I choose you!\" and plumped\n",
      "herself on his lap, to the suppressed delight of Isabel and Miss\n",
      "Montgomery. But Gwynne looked blankly at her ill-buttoned back and the\n",
      "immense buckle of her belt, while the rest of the party, those that sat\n",
      "and those that swung to and fro at the straps, mocked her for choosing\n",
      "so unresponsive a knight. The car stopped to accommodate another relay,\n",
      "and Gwynne by a deft movement transferred the lady to his own seat, and\n",
      "engineered the girls out of the car, before two hoodlums, who were\n",
      "working their way up from the lower door, could reach them.\n",
      "They found a garage and a good automobile, and spent an hour or two out\n",
      "on the ocean boulevard. When they returned to town, Miss Montgomery\n",
      "alighted at one of the hotels where she was to dine; and, the chauffeur\n",
      "announcing that he could not \"make another hill,\" Gwynne and Isabel\n",
      "started for home on foot.\n",
      "The city rose in a succession of hills from the level, and they climbed\n",
      "slowly, talking little. Suddenly Gwynne laid his hand on Isabel's arm\n",
      "and stopped, directing her gaze upward. They were at the foot of one of\n",
      "the narrow almost perpendicular blocks that rose between Pine and\n",
      "California streets. On either side were brown old-fashioned houses,\n",
      "several of them set back from the street, and surrounded by trees and\n",
      "high close fences. It was almost dark, but a moon was due, so the street\n",
      "lamps were not lit. Crawling down from the street above, on one side\n",
      "only, and clinging to the upper houses, was the advance guard of the\n",
      "fog. It had come in stealthily and halted for a moment, taking strange\n",
      "shapes. It looked like the ghost of an ancient fog, and the very houses,\n",
      "in which not a light had appeared, might have been deserted for a\n",
      "century. In a moment it began to crawl down the side of the street,\n",
      "seeming to fill the whole city with silence. It was a scene\n",
      "indescribably gloomy, haunting, forbidding, and to Gwynne, who had\n",
      "studied the city in many lonely rambles, to whisper of the unrelieved\n",
      "gloom of lives behind that stage where the most famous of American\n",
      "Follies danced for ever in her cap and bells. The spirit of sympathy was\n",
      "in the fog and the brief darkness for the thousands of broken dogged men\n",
      "and women that rarely caught sight of the cap and bells. For them the\n",
      "ashes, the embittered memories, the blasted hopes, a quiet sullen hatred\n",
      "for the city that had devoured their hearts and left them automatons.\n",
      "This was a phase of the city's life of which the enthusiastic shallow\n",
      "tourist had never a hint. It took a man of genius like Gwynne to feel\n",
      "the genius of the city in all its sinister variety. He had hardly pieced\n",
      "his impressions together as yet, but he told Isabel a little of what his\n",
      "subconscious ego had formulated, and she had never liked him so well as\n",
      "when she took his arm and they ascended into the sudden downrush of the\n",
      "fog.\n",
      "XXXVI\n",
      "Gwynne returned to Lumalitas on the following day and Isabel moved down\n",
      "to Mrs. Hofer's. This had seemed a rather superfluous proceeding to Miss\n",
      "Otis, but Mrs. Hofer would take no denial, and lodged her guest in a\n",
      "suite the luxury of which at first delighted and then stifled her. She\n",
      "liked splendor and luxury in the abstract, but some lingering shade of\n",
      "Puritanism in her resented the enthralment of the higher faculties. Her\n",
      "rooms were upholstered with satin from floor to ceiling, the\n",
      "toilet-table was bedecked with gold, and the furniture had been made for\n",
      "some favorite of Napoleon during the First Empire. Isabel was haunted by\n",
      "a vague sense of impropriety, which she ridiculed but could not stifle.\n",
      "And for the first time in her life she became weary of flowers. When she\n",
      "arrived there was an abundance of the more costly in her boudoir--those\n",
      "that were raised in hot-houses that the rich might not be balked in\n",
      "their laudable desire to spend--and before the week was over, her rooms,\n",
      "as she wrote to Gwynne--chuckling on his veranda--looked like a\n",
      "florist's shop and smelt like a funeral. Everybody she met, and several\n",
      "that she did not, sent her the floral tribute. The bell rang every hour.\n",
      "When the imperturbable footman finally appeared with a box that looked\n",
      "like a child's coffin, Isabel told him pettishly to throw it into the\n",
      "back yard. All Americans send flowers to a pretty girl as a matter of\n",
      "course, but the San Franciscan indulges in an avalanche where his more\n",
      "economical Eastern brother is content with good measure, pressed down,\n",
      "but not running over.\n",
      "But the offerings were by no means confined to the young men that Isabel\n",
      "met at the functions of the week. \"Old friends of the family\" were\n",
      "interested to welcome to their midst the beautiful daughter (albeit\n",
      "somewhat eccentric) of Jim Otis and Mary Belmont. Enthusiastic maidens,\n",
      "and others--anxious to proclaim their delight in this sudden invasion of\n",
      "their preserves--sent roses with stems four feet long and chrysanthemums\n",
      "that looked like painted cauliflowers. After a tea at the Presidio,\n",
      "given in the open square, and in honor of the descendant of its most\n",
      "historic Commandante, Don Jose Argueello, that reclaimed precinct being\n",
      "singularly prolific in flowers, the offerings arrived on the following\n",
      "day in an ambulance.\n",
      "It was an energetic week. When Mrs. Hofer was not herself entertaining,\n",
      "she and her guest lunched and dined out daily, attended several teas\n",
      "every afternoon, a _cotillon_, a skating masque, and five balls. Two of\n",
      "the luncheons were at Burlingame and Menlo Park, whence they motored as\n",
      "valiantly as if the roads were European. How so much was crowded into\n",
      "one short week Isabel never understood, but finally came to the\n",
      "conclusion that the rush at its worst was better than remaining for two\n",
      "consecutive waking hours in the Hofer mansion. Mrs. Hofer was always\n",
      "amiable and charming, but she was overwhelming. Her energies demanded\n",
      "the safety-valve of constant speech, and she was one of those American\n",
      "hostesses that hold that to neglect a guest is an unpardonable breach of\n",
      "hospitality. She even gave up bridge for the week. Moreover, Isabel was\n",
      "not long discovering that she contributed her part towards the\n",
      "sustenance of that wondrous buoyancy, those eternal high spirits, that\n",
      "glorious _joie de vivre_. The woman was an unconscious vampire. Men did\n",
      "not feel it, and saw only her irresistible youth, but she squeezed women\n",
      "as she did her morning sponge, and had no real intimates; although few,\n",
      "herself least of all, understood the secret. If she had liked Isabel\n",
      "less, it would have been more endurable, but she had never liked any one\n",
      "more, to say nothing of the fact that she was determined to give her\n",
      "\"the time of her life.\" She descended upon her helpless guest with a\n",
      "rush of silken skirts--that sounded like wings--and a torrent of bright\n",
      "chatter, during every unoccupied hour or moment. Isabel's only\n",
      "experience of hospitality heretofore had been in England, where a guest\n",
      "might die and be resurrected between the formal hours of reunion and the\n",
      "hostess be none the wiser. It had never occurred to her that visiting\n",
      "might become hard labor, and as she had met few people whom she had\n",
      "liked as spontaneously as Ada Hofer, she had come to her without a\n",
      "misgiving. But she was soon hiding behind the curtains of the big rooms\n",
      "down-stairs, and, upon one memorable occasion, took refuge under the\n",
      "library table, while the sweet rapid voice of the hostess clarioned\n",
      "throughout the house. She was drawn guiltily forth by a deep chuckle\n",
      "from the arm-chair in the window. Mr. Toole regarded her with a twinkle\n",
      "in his bright old eyes, and no resentment.\n",
      "\"I won't tell on ye,\" he said. \"I feel like it meself, at times. Ada's a\n",
      "good child, as good as a born egoist can be, but--well--we are not all\n",
      "made on the same plan. And this life don't suit you. You're a dreamer. I\n",
      "know one when I see one, for I've that side to meself, and now that\n",
      "life is easy it's most the only side I've got left. Sit down in that\n",
      "corner behind the bookcase and I'll read to you from one of the old\n",
      "poets, Byron, belike. If Ada finds us, I'll send her kiting. She didn't\n",
      "bring me up.\"\n",
      "When Isabel, in the solitude of her bed, found time to think, she\n",
      "concluded that if she could eliminate all men from her week except Mr.\n",
      "Hofer and those of his particular set, she might still enjoy herself.\n",
      "The San Francisco society youth has always been a failure. Except in\n",
      "rare instances he has not been outside his native State, has read\n",
      "nothing, and is casual of manner. Although more young men of the favored\n",
      "class attend the home universities than formerly, the students that\n",
      "derive the full benefit of these institutions are rarely those that\n",
      "intend to make a business of dancing, and calling on Sunday afternoons.\n",
      "It is yet too soon to weld cultivation with leisure, and, for the matter\n",
      "of that, most of the society youth have their living to make, combining\n",
      "business and fashion with a moderate success. Like Wellington's puppies,\n",
      "they have proved themselves of sound metal when put to the crucial test,\n",
      "but as an intellectual diversion they might as well be mechanical toys.\n",
      "The leader has not yet arisen that can permanently combine the older and\n",
      "younger sets. They mingle at great functions, but the dancing set\n",
      "monopolizes the season's stage.\n",
      "Of this set Mrs. Hofer was an enthusiastic member, and even at dinner\n",
      "rarely entertained any other. Occasionally, and once during Isabel's\n",
      "visit, she invited some friends of her husband, who never went to\n",
      "parties, and often entertained when his wife was elsewhere; but these\n",
      "men did as much talking as listening, and that was no part of Mrs.\n",
      "Hofer's system. Isabel had flashing vistas of small groups of men and\n",
      "women, distinguished socially as well as mentally, that entertained each\n",
      "other, or met at a new club through which Mrs. Hofer whisked her one\n",
      "night,--a club where the best of Bohemia met the more intellectual\n",
      "members of society; and she knew that in these groups she might find\n",
      "also the higher class business and professional men, and a few of\n",
      "leisure that enjoyed life without either dancing or drinking. But Mrs.\n",
      "Hofer, although far too well satisfied with life and herself to be a\n",
      "snob, loved brilliancy, splendor, constant excitement, dancing, chatter;\n",
      "and only her chosen set could provide the banquet. She could dance every\n",
      "night from ten until two, and awaken in mid-morning as fresh as a rose.\n",
      "She had the wardrobe of the storied princess, and her guests and friends\n",
      "must contribute their share to the brilliancy of all gatherings. She\n",
      "detested shabbiness; it was the only thing that depressed her spirits.\n",
      "Proud as she was of her husband, his aims, and his position in the\n",
      "community, his friends and their themes frankly bored her. She liked\n",
      "talk, not conversation. She really loved him, however, and was far too\n",
      "clever to let him feel neglected. He was inordinately proud of her, and\n",
      "grateful that she permitted him to give his time to his own interests,\n",
      "instead of dragging him about to groan against the wall. She had her\n",
      "little crosses and disappointments, for she had many servants and\n",
      "dressmakers; but, on the whole, Isabel had never seen any one so\n",
      "persistently happy, nor with more reason. Even her three children were\n",
      "as sturdy as young calves, and although they yelled like demons for an\n",
      "hour every morning--reawaking to the sense of a vague something life\n",
      "still denied them, and infuriated at the thought--Mrs. Hofer merely\n",
      "turned over on her pillow with an indulgent smile. It never occurred to\n",
      "her that the rest of the household might be less indulgent; and the\n",
      "nursery above Isabel's room was not the least of the causes that\n",
      "contributed to a frantic longing for the thirty-first of December.\n",
      "XXXVII\n",
      "But it was not until four o'clock on the day of release that she found\n",
      "herself actually alone in her chilly and chaste boudoir on the higher\n",
      "hill; Mrs. Hofer escorted her home and remained for many last words.\n",
      "Then Isabel fell into a chair before the mounting fire and shut her\n",
      "eyes. Lady Victoria was out. Gwynne was not expected until the evening\n",
      "train. She wished that she had not promised to dine with the Stones at\n",
      "seven. The house was as silent as a tomb; but while she was still\n",
      "rejoicing in the sudden cessation of sound and motion, the door opened\n",
      "and Gwynne entered. She gave him a surly nod, and he explained that he\n",
      "had come down in the morning, in order to be at hand to welcome her; had\n",
      "even meditated going to her rescue. Isabel deigned no reply, and he took\n",
      "possession of a deep chair, settled himself on his backbone, and\n",
      "regarded her attentively.\n",
      "\"I am sorry you have not enjoyed your week as much as I have done,\" he\n",
      "observed. \"The weather has been magnificent, and I have spent all the\n",
      "days out-of-doors, riding, walking, duck-shooting--taking liberties with\n",
      "your boat, and even your launch. I never enjoyed myself more--after such\n",
      "close study, and all the rest of it, I suppose. I must say you don't\n",
      "look very fit. You are pale instead of white, and--well--cross. Judging\n",
      "from those models of literary elegance and Christian charity, the San\n",
      "Francisco weekly society sheets--with which I whiled away that infernal\n",
      "train journey--you have been feted like visiting royalty, photographed\n",
      "by the foremost in his art--which would appear to be the equivalent of\n",
      "painted for the Academy--and your family history seems to have been\n",
      "written up from old files, with even more picturesqueness than\n",
      "accuracy--\"\n",
      "\"I wish you would keep still. You didn't talk half so much in England. I\n",
      "shall hate you if you become wholly American.\"\n",
      "\"I am a born egotist. Ask my mother. Or my long-suffering friends and\n",
      "constituents. You did all the talking at Capheaton--or gave me a wide\n",

      "and many staid and strenuous business men were promenading with their\n",

      "ribbons of many hues. The street-cars had stopped, but there were a\n",

      "the pavement and hurling confetti.\n",

      "The people in the windows wore their gayest attire, and there was often\n",
      "music as well as light behind them. They threw down confetti by the\n",
      "bushel on the masses below. And the masses! There was no polite\n",
      "restraint here. Largely recruited from the immense South of Market\n",
      "Street district, they were out for a good time, and its inevitable\n",
      "expression was noise. They were in the best of tempers, but the din was\n",
      "terrific. They hooted and yelled, and every one of the several thousand\n",
      "had a tin horn and blew it with all his might. Every undefended ear was\n",
      "victimized. Isabel pressed one of her own against Stone's shoulder and\n",
      "covered the other with her hand. But she stared at the crowd with all\n",
      "the interest of the secluded for the mass. There were painted ladies of\n",
      "all grades, and hundreds of shop-girls, covered with white paint or\n",
      "lavender powder, their figures exaggerated with the corset of the\n",
      "moment, and violent plumage on head and waist, although they had\n",
      "prudently left their best skirts at home. Many of them were\n",
      "astonishingly pretty, and no doubt more respectable than they looked.\n",
      "Mrs. Paula was in her element. She wore her red hat and blouse, waved\n",
      "her hands to the windows, exulted in the showers of confetti that\n",
      "descended in response, and shouted into Gwynne's ear that she was\n",
      "singled out for special attentions. In truth she received more than her\n",
      "escort relished. Her natural affinity with the class above which she had\n",
      "risen so high had never been more patent, and kindred spirits looked\n",
      "from many approving eyes. Suddenly both cheeks were painted black by a\n",
      "too fraternal hand, and then a man tried to kiss her. This was more than\n",
      "even Paula could stand, and she flung herself into her husband's arms,\n",
      "daubing his shirt with black and red. He dropped Isabel and struck out\n",
      "furiously. There was an immediate scuffle, during which Gwynne basely\n",

      "crowd.\n",
      "\"We have had enough of them, and no doubt they have had of us,\" he said,\n",
      "comfortably. \"Now we will enjoy ourselves.\"\n",
      "\"Well, if they blacken my face don't notice them. One would think Lyster\n",
      "would know how to play the game by this time.\"\n",
      "\"He is always ready to fight after the fifth glass of champagne. I have\n",
      "had lively experiences with him.\"\n",
      "Conversation was impossible in the din. Isabel's face was smudged more\n",
      "than once, but no other liberty was attempted. Gwynne also looked like a\n",
      "chimney-sweep, and was addressed as \"darling\" several times, but the\n",
      "crowd was inoffensive until a chain-gang of hoodlums dashed irresistibly\n",
      "through it, pushing many off the sidewalk, and rousing a lurid\n",
      "accompaniment. One man, solid and stolid, stood his ground on the edge\n",
      "of the chain and administered a hearty kick upon each ankle as it\n",
      "passed. There were angry howls in response, but none could retaliate\n",
      "without breaking the chain, nor indeed could they control its momentum.\n",
      "\"That is one of those things one would like to have thought of one's\n",

      "well get out of this.\"\n",
      "They slowly made their way into one of the cross streets that seemed to\n",
      "leap like a blazing meteor down from the darkness of the heights. But\n",
      "the crowd was still as dense, and the street but a third the width of\n",
      "Market Street. Not even an automobile attempted to force its way. Saloon\n",
      "doors were swinging. Policemen stood in front of them, but there was no\n",
      "further disorder. Gwynne and Isabel pressed back against the wall of a\n",
      "shop and watched and waited. They were to celebrate the birth of the New\n",
      "Year with the Hofers at a restaurant on the block above, but there was\n",
      "no prospect of reaching it at present.\n",
      "The sky was cloudless. If the evening chill had come in from the\n",
      "Pacific, it was routed by the mass of humanity and the downpour of heat\n",
      "from the electric lights. All the great signs were blazing, many in\n",
      "colors. And there was music in all the saloons and restaurants; it rose\n",
      "and fell with the noise of the tin horn and the hoot of the happy. The\n",
      "people in the windows here threw down not only confetti but flowers, and\n",
      "stacks at each elbow added to the mass of color. Even the men had tied\n",
      "bright silk handkerchiefs about their necks, and they were bestrewed\n",
      "with bits of gold and silver paper, and festooned with colored ribbon.\n",
      "Gwynne and Isabel were quickly singled out and pelted with balls that\n",
      "opened with the impact and tangled them together with the endless paper\n",
      "streamers.\n",
      "It was eleven o'clock before the crowd began its retreat to their\n",
      "restaurants, and Gwynne and Isabel were able to make their way up to the\n",
      "celebrated resort where the Hofers awaited them. They were shown to a\n",
      "dressing-room where they could wash their faces, and then to the gallery\n",
      "above the body of the restaurant which was divided into boxes, and\n",
      "occupied by all sorts and kinds of people, including many of their\n",
      "friends. In Hofer's box was a large bottle on ice and a table set for\n",
      "supper. Mrs. Hofer, looking less approving than earlier in the evening,\n",
      "sat half-hidden by a curtain, but her husband, in common with most of\n",
      "the other people in the gallery, was throwing confetti upon his friends\n",
      "below. He seized Gwynne and dragged him to the front of the box, and the\n",
      "new arrival was greeted by shouts from every man, it seemed to him, that\n",
      "he had met in San Francisco. The large hall with its tables of all sizes\n",
      "was as densely packed as the streets had been.\n",
      "\"Ever see anything like this before?\" demanded Hofer. He paused with a\n",
      "gasp and dislodged a ball of confetti from his throat. \"Look with all\n",
      "your eyes, old man. There are the best and the worst--all who can pay\n",
      "the price: the reformers cheek by jowl with the mayor and the Boss, by\n",
      "Jove! The matron and the other kind of matron, the fair young girl who\n",
      "hopes to buy a rich husband, and the sort that has to give more and take\n",
      "less; the family man and his family, not a bit afraid of contamination,\n",
      "enjoying himself to the limit; financiers, millionaires, corporation\n",
      "bosses and curb-stone brokers, newspaper men, artists, politicians big\n",
      "and little, society youths and girls severely chaperoned. See that crowd\n",
      "with the queens of the Tenderloin? Ever hear what one of our local wits\n",
      "said about them: 'Pity the worst of men should be named for the best of\n",
      "fish!'\"\n",
      "Hofer, who felt it his duty as a good citizen to empty his bottle with\n",
      "the rest of the world on New Year's eve, rattled on. Mrs. Hofer gave an\n",
      "occasional warning cough. Like most San Francisco women of her class\n",
      "there was a good deal of prudery under her gayety, and no instinct\n",
      "whatever for Bohemia. She had come to the restaurant because her husband\n",
      "had urged it, but she took no part, and threw only an occasional glance\n",
      "at the floor. But as Isabel was manifestly interested, she presented her\n",
      "arm and hat to the gaze of the crowd, that her guest might partake in\n",
      "the doubtful fun if she wished.\n",
      "Isabel and Gwynne, still tangled in the paper streamers and vigorously\n",
      "pelted from below, leaned eagerly over the railing and flung handsful of\n",
      "gold and silver bits upon the already glittering throng. It certainly\n",
      "was an astonishing sight. There was little seeking after\n",
      "inconspicuousness, even in the boxes. All were there to celebrate the\n",
      "birth of the New Year, and to \"play the game,\" however chastened they\n",
      "might feel on the morrow. All were drinking champagne and growing more\n",
      "hilarious every moment. One girl modestly dressed, and known to Mrs.\n",
      "Hofer as an entirely respectable young person, although not of her own\n",
      "class, was sitting on the knee of the man she was to marry, and drinking\n",
      "from his glass. The ladies of the lower ten thousand were nicely graded.\n",
      "Some were dressed with a severe and simple elegance, and painted as\n",
      "delicately as a miniature. These were very quiet, the carven smile on\n",
      "their crimson lips not disturbing the careful arrangement of their\n",
      "features; and their eyes never lost their jewel-like immobility. They\n",
      "were attended by what is vaguely known as \"men about town,\" men with\n",
      "money to spend and no position to lose. It was no longer the fashion\n",
      "among conspicuous men to flaunt their mistresses, but these indefinite\n",
      "persons kept the old traditions alive. Still other women blazed with\n",
      "paint and jewels and excessive richness of attire. In attendance were\n",
      "the big sleek brutes, whom all other men held in contempt. But all were\n",
      "happy to-night and asking no man for his respect.\n",
      "At a table in the very middle of the room was a young, buxom, and very\n",
      "naughty-looking damsel, who evidently was a belle: the circle of black\n",
      "coats about her round table was unbroken save by herself. What dress she\n",
      "wore was black, and on her golden head was an immense black hat covered\n",
      "with feathers. Her abundant diamonds were almost overwhelmed. Every time\n",
      "one of her escort raised his glass to his lips he toasted her, and she\n",
      "rose to respond, presumably to give the company the benefit of the tiny\n",
      "waist that tapered off the white acre above. She was irreverently\n",
      "hooted, but imperturbably rose and fell like a jack-in-the-box.\n",
      "Hofer finally sat down to supper with his guests, but they had barely\n",
      "finished when every clock in town began to boom the midnight hour and\n",
      "there was a wild ringing of bells all over the city. Down-stairs one of\n",
      "the young men ran to the orchestra, whirled the leader from his seat,\n",
      "flung off his own coat, and led the crashing music with a tin horn.\n",
      "Hofer and Gwynne went to the front of the box, glasses in hand. All\n",
      "below had sprung to their feet and were waving and clicking their\n",
      "champagne-glasses, singing, catcalling, tooting, cheering. Even Isabel\n",
      "and Mrs. Hofer leaned forward. In the turmoil they did not notice that\n",
      "the young woman in the centre of the room was standing on her table, her\n",
      "befeathered head flung back, draining her glass; but they turned just in\n",
      "time to see one of her admirers rifle her bodice and wag his trove at\n",
      "the company.\n",
      "\"This is too much!\" cried Mrs. Hofer, furiously, and running to the\n",
      "back of the box. \"Nicolas, I insist!\" But Nicolas was enjoying himself\n",
      "immensely and paid no attention.\n",
      "Isabel had been about to follow Mrs. Hofer when she lost her breath and\n",
      "nearly fell over the edge of the box. Lady Victoria, accompanied by a\n",
      "man who was unmistakably a pugilist, had entered by a side door.\n",
      "Isabel's brain seemed to eliminate every thought it had ever possessed\n",
      "and hurriedly to remodel down to one agonizing point. The pair were\n",
      "endeavoring to force their way forward to a table that evidently had\n",
      "been reserved for them. Gwynne was leaning over the railing drinking to\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Trennahan. In a moment his interested eyes would rove over\n",
      "the crowd again. Isabel suddenly fell on him, bearing him backward.\n",
      "\"Take me out--quick!\" she gasped. \"I am horribly ill!\"\n",
      "Gwynne, grasping his hat, was fairly borne out of the box. As Isabel was\n",
      "ghastly and trembling he assumed that she was really ill, and made no\n",
      "protest, but half-carried her down the stair. They attracted no\n",
      "attention and reached the sidewalk in a moment.\n",
      "\"If we can only find a carriage!\" he said, solicitously. \"You never can\n",
      "walk up those hills. What an atmosphere that was! I don't wonder you\n",
      "came a cropper. I hope the Hofers won't mind--\"\n",
      "\"Nobody minds anything.\"\n",
      "She took his arm and they walked up the street. The bells were still\n",
      "ringing, horns tooting, but the street was comparatively empty. At the\n",
      "corner a Salvation Army corps was singing hymns to a flabby and penitent\n",
      "congregation. Just beyond was a row of hacks awaiting the weary\n",
      "reveller, and in a moment Gwynne and Isabel were driving rapidly along a\n",
      "dark and deserted street.\n",
      "\"Do you feel better?\" he asked.\n",
      "She did not answer for a moment, afraid of breaking down. Gwynne was\n",
      "sure to offer prompt consolation, and even if he assumed the brotherly\n",
      "attitude, she had no wish to be taken in his arms. In spite of herself\n",
      "his calm reiteration that he intended to marry her had forced its seed\n",
      "into her brain, for ideas projected from bold determined minds are\n",
      "insistent things. But never had love and all connected with it been so\n",
      "hateful to her as at this moment. He peered into her face.\n",
      "\"You are not going to cry!\" he exclaimed. \"You!\"\n",
      "\"No, I am not! But I never was so nearly overcome. Such noise! Such\n",
      "sights! Such heat! It was too bad to take you away, though. Shall you go\n",
      "back?\"\n",
      "\"Not I! May I smoke? We shall be an hour reaching the base of our cliff\n",
      "at this rate. He is apparently going out to the cemeteries under\n",
      "pretence of avoiding the hills.\"\n",
      "He elevated his feet to the opposite seat and lit a cigarette.\n",
      "\"I wish my mother had come home before we left. It was a pity for her to\n",
      "miss this. Even if she would not dine with us, I could have returned for\n",
      "her.\"\n",
      "\"I saw her in the crowd with a party of people. I might have told you,\n",
      "but my mind has been in as many pieces to-night as a bag full of\n",
      "confetti. I am sure she has seen it all.\"\n",
      "\"Good. It was what you might call a trifle variegated, but not to be\n",
      "missed. Great old town, this! No wonder they think California is the\n",
      "world, out here. It is what they say of the London flats:\n",
      "'self-contained.' I like Hofer better than ever. The man whom champagne\n",
      "transforms into a big silly boy is the right sort. Is there really a\n",
      "workaday world, a city to reform, and two ranches up the valley?\"\n",

      "They reached home sooner than might have been expected, but there were\n",
      "many fares below, and the hackman galloped down the hill as recklessly\n",
      "as if a slip would not have been the death of himself and his valiant\n",
      "beasts.\n",
      "Isabel went directly to her room and persuaded Gwynne to go to his,\n",
      "arguing that some one of his mother's party would be sure to bring her\n",
      "home. As he was to take the 7:30 train he made no protest. Even were he\n",
      "still awake when Lady Victoria returned, the fog was rolling in; nor was\n",
      "he likely to be leaning from his window.\n",
      "Isabel heard her come in two hours later, and it was another hour before\n",
      "she slept. She had determined to ask her wayward but still awesome\n",
      "relative to leave San Francisco before her son found her out or she had\n",
      "time more fully to disgrace him. But how to approach the most\n",
      "unapproachable woman she had ever known with so delicate a proposition\n",
      "was a question that made her toss about her ancestral bed and kept the\n",
      "blood in her brain. She recalled the slip of paper announcing a\n",
      "prize-fight, and wondered at her stupidity; for she had heard something\n",
      "of the resources of blasee women ere this.\n",
      "Finally she fell asleep. She was awakened by a sharp earthquake--grim\n",
      "herald of the coming year! She was too well seasoned to have felt\n",
      "anything more than a passing annoyance, had she not heard Lady Victoria\n",
      "give a piercing scream and run from her room. Whereupon she rejoiced\n",
      "wickedly, flung a wrapper across her shoulders, and went into the hall.\n",
      "Gwynne was standing in his doorway, looking more asleep than awake, and\n",
      "intensely disapproving. Lady Victoria was leaning against the wall, her\n",
      "eyes wide with terror. Isabel took her firmly by the arm, marched her\n",
      "into her room, helped her into a dressing-gown, and, pushing her into a\n",
      "chair, took one opposite.\n",
      "\"How dreadful!\" exclaimed Lady Victoria. \"I had forgotten about\n",
      "earthquakes--\"\n",
      "\"Earthquake!\" said Isabel, contemptuously. \"That was a mere vibration.\n",
      "We had sixty-two of those last winter. If you only stay long enough we\n",
      "will show you what California really can do. Every ten years or so we\n",
      "have a good hard shake--enough to bring the plaster down; and every\n",
      "half-century or so she gets up and turns over. I have made a specialty\n",
      "of earthquakes, and could tell you extraordinary tales of some of the\n",
      "great ones of the south--\"\n",
      "\"Please do not. I prefer to forget. But don't leave me. Fancy Angelique\n",
      "sleeping through such a thing!\"\n",
      "\"Doubtless she is not in the house. All the world was out last night.\"\n",
      "\"Was it?\"\n",
      "\"I think this as good a time as any other to tell you, Cousin Victoria,\n",
      "that I saw you last night--just as the clocks were striking twelve.\"\n",
      "\"Did you?\"\n",
      "Her trained features did not betray her, but Isabel saw the figure under\n",
      "the loose gown grow rigid and brace itself against the back of the\n",
      "chair. And as Isabel stared at her, with the desperate courage born of\n",
      "the sudden plunge, it seemed to her that she felt a vibration from the\n",
      "nausea, the disgust, the hatred of life, the death-rattle of great\n",
      "passions dying hard. She wondered again, if, given the same conditions,\n",
      "she would have differed much from the woman she had brought to bay. Her\n",
      "early trials and provincial upbringing had developed her Puritan\n",
      "inheritance, but she had had flashing and startling glimpses of her\n",
      "depths now and again. For a moment she felt the waters of an immemorial\n",
      "ennui rise high in her own soul, then drop to the grinning skulls and\n",
      "sparkless ashes of old pleasures. She shuddered back, and raised her\n",
      "eyes once more to the haughty mask opposite.\n",
      "\"I think I understand,\" she said, gently. \"But you must go. I kept him\n",
      "from seeing you to-night. But he would find out in time. As you know how\n",
      "he believes in you, you can imagine the consequences. I suppose you have\n",
      "not done anything so public before, or I should have heard of it. I\n",
      "vaguely recall that women can look on at prize-fights from private\n",
      "boxes. Last night, it isn't likely that any one noticed. Or if they did\n",
      "they would question the evidence of their senses in the morning, the\n",
      "best of them. So please go.\"\n",
      "She paused. Lady Victoria stared at her without the slightest change of\n",
      "expression. Isabel continued imperturbably. \"London is so vast--if you\n",
      "must have that sort of liberty, for heaven's sake go where it is most\n",
      "likely to be overlooked--and where libel laws are operative. For all its\n",
      "license, San Francisco is one of the most censorious and unrelenting\n",
      "societies in the world, and has more old-fashioned people than New York.\n",
      "If you become the talk of the town, and those awful weekly papers find\n",
      "you out, Elton will be a long while living it down. It will make\n",
      "ridiculous all his efforts at reform. Perhaps he would no longer care. I\n",
      "fancy it would affect him that way.\"\n",
      "She rose, and Lady Victoria rose also and walked to the door. As she\n",
      "opened it she smiled grimly. \"You have courage,\" she said. \"I am more\n",
      "than ever convinced that you are the wife for Jack. I will go.\"\n",

      "1906\n",
      "I\n",
      "On the same afternoon Lady Victoria developed appendicitis and went to\n",
      "bed for two months. She was only in danger for a short time, but the\n",
      "doctor announced his intention of giving her a rest cure, and his\n",
      "patient, who was profoundly indifferent, made no protest. And if\n",
      "invalidism is a career, an illness is an adventure; moreover, no doubt,\n",
      "it was a relief to Victoria Gwynne to have her thinking done by some one\n",
      "else for a time. Isabel had thoughtfully rung up the handsomest doctor\n",
      "in San Francisco the moment the disease declared itself, and it was to\n",
      "be expected that he would find his patient interesting enough to spend\n",
      "an hour by her bedside daily. It was manifestly impossible to transfer a\n",
      "woman of Lady Victoria's heroic proportions down that rickety and almost\n",
      "perpendicular flight of steps to an ambulance, but the best of nurses\n",
      "were engaged, Anne Montgomery agreed to come every morning and attend to\n",
      "the housekeeping, Gwynne established a long-distance telephone beside\n",
      "the bed, and Mrs. Trennahan, whom Lady Victoria liked--she could not\n",
      "stand Mrs. Hofer--promised a daily visit; and an automobile trip to the\n",
      "south as soon as the doctor would permit.\n",
      "It was nearly a week before Isabel, who had sat up with Gwynne during\n",
      "the first two nights, and been on the rush ever since, was able to\n",
      "return to her ranch. She had offered to remain in town altogether, but\n",
      "Lady Victoria replied with some show of irritation that if either she or\n",
      "her son sacrificed their time and interests on her account it would\n",
      "oppress her mind with a sense of guilt, and hinder her recovery. She\n",
      "would telephone to them at a certain hour every day, and if they came\n",
      "down once a week as usual she should enjoy seeing them, instead of being\n",
      "worried by a sense of obligation. In truth she was glad to be rid of\n",
      "them for more reasons than one.\n",
      "It was late in the afternoon when Isabel arrived in Rosewater, and\n",
      "business detained her there for several hours. She dined with the Tom\n",
      "Coltons, and the conversation was a quaint mixture of babies, politics,\n",
      "servants, and the Hofer ball. Colton drove her home, and talked the\n",
      "steady monotonous stream with which he tricked the world into believing\n",
      "that his own ideas were still in the germ. Upon this occasion he might\n",
      "as well have betrayed his secrets or quoted the poets, for Isabel paid\n",
      "no attention whatever to his monologue. She was consumed with her desire\n",
      "to be alone once more. She was tired of the very sound of the human\n",
      "voice, and remembered with satisfaction the silence of her Chuma and the\n",
      "taciturnity of her men.\n",
      "When she finally reached her home she illuminated it from top to bottom\n",
      "and wandered about in a passion of delight. Her sensation of gratitude\n",
      "and novelty in her solitude and freedom could not have been keener if\n",
      "she had been absent for six months. Although it was too cold to sit\n",
      "out-of-doors, she walked up and down the piazza for an hour, watching\n",
      "the crawling tide and the brown tumbled hills. The boat was late, and\n",
      "every other light was out when it appeared, a mere string of magic\n",
      "lanterns with a red globe suspended aloft. Isabel struck a match and\n",
      "answered the captain's familiar greeting from his high perch in the\n",
      "pilot-house; then went within, for the fog was rolling over Tamalpais,\n",
      "dropping down the mountains in great sea waves. But even then she would\n",
      "not go to bed, and lose her knowledge of recovered treasure. After a\n",
      "time, however, she fell asleep in her chair before the fire. She awoke\n",
      "suddenly, but drowsily surprised and disappointed not to find Gwynne in\n",
      "the chair opposite. Then she became aware of the cause of her\n",
      "interrupted slumbers. There was the sound of fire-arms and of barking\n",
      "dogs on the hills sacred to the Leghorn. In three minutes she had her\n",
      "skirts off, her high boots on, and was running, pistol in hand, to the\n",
      "colony, announcing her coming by a preliminary discharge. Then for the\n",
      "next hour she and her men fought one of those hordes of migratory rats\n",
      "that suddenly steal upon chicken-ranches and leave ruin behind them.\n",
      "Isabel had a genuine horror of rats. She would far rather have faced an\n",
      "army of snakes; but with her rubber boots, the well-trained dogs, and\n",
      "her accuracy of aim, she had nothing to fear. Those that were not\n",
      "slaughtered were finally driven off, and Isabel, content even in this\n",
      "phase of her strictly personal life, went to bed and slept the sleep of\n",
      "youth and health and an easy conscience.\n",
      "The next day began the torrential rains that lasted for three weeks,\n",
      "almost without an hour's intermission; that wiped out the marsh, and\n",
      "threatened floods for all the valleys of the north. The boats no longer\n",
      "looked as if cutting their way through the lands, but adrift on a great\n",
      "lake. Tamalpais and the mountains below it had disappeared, as if\n",
      "hibernating, and the winds raged up and down the long valley, shaking\n",
      "old houses like Isabel's to their foundations, and leaving not a leaf\n",
      "on the trees. Nothing could be wilder or more desolate than the scene\n",
      "from Isabel's piazza, where, encased in rubber, she took her exercise,\n",
      "often battling every inch of one way against a driving wall of rain.\n",
      "Rosewater, or any sort of house except her own, she did not see for days\n",
      "at a time, nothing but that gray foaming muttering expanse of water, its\n",
      "flood and fall no longer distinguishable. At first she was more than\n",
      "content to be so isolated. Her practical life occupied little of her\n",
      "time; only a daily, and always unexpected, dash up the slopes to see\n",
      "that her men were not shirking their duties, and a weekly trip to\n",
      "Rosewater with her produce: she used her own incubators in bad weather.\n",
      "A visit to San Francisco she did not attempt, and she was quite sure\n",
      "that the daily conversation over the telephone--when it had not blown\n",
      "down--was as sufficing for Lady Victoria as for herself. She read and\n",
      "studied and dreamed, became indifferent to what she chose to call her\n",
      "failure as a society ornament, and planned a larger future; to be\n",
      "realized when she had come to care less for dreams and more for\n",
      "realities. No doubt that state of mind would develop before long, and\n",
      "meanwhile she might as well enjoy herself according to her present mood.\n",
      "Nothing could alter her belief that all unhappiness came from contacts,\n",
      "and certainly she had proved her theories so far, and took a pagan joy\n",
      "in mere living. She loved the wild battle of the elements, the waste\n",
      "below her garden, with as keen a sensuousness as the spring and the\n",
      "flowers, and often sat late in her red room by the fire to enjoy its\n",
      "contrast with the desolation without.\n",
      "But Gwynne was not a man to be dismissed from the thoughts of any one\n",
      "that knew him as well as his cousin, He had taken his part in her life\n",
      "as a matter of course, and of late they had been very intimate. During\n",
      "the first days and nights of his mother's illness, they had talked, or\n",
      "sat in companionable silence, by the hour. She had been assailed by\n",
      "regrets more than once that she was to have no part in his life, that he\n",
      "had already won some of his hardest battles with no help of hers, and\n",
      "deliberately had matched their spirits and driven her off the field\n",
      "where she had subtly sought to manage him. She liked him the better for\n",
      "this, but while her vanity retired with philosophy, she regretted her\n",
      "inability to help him. That she had it in her to assist and encourage\n",
      "him in many ways, she needed to be told neither by himself nor his\n",
      "mother, but she was unwilling to pay the price. That she felt his charm,\n",
      "took an even deeper interest in him since he had announced his intention\n",
      "to marry her, she did not pretend to deny, and sometimes caught herself\n",
      "looking out upon a future in which he had as inevitable a part as if it\n",
      "had been decreed from the beginning of time. She also dreamed of the\n",
      "satisfaction and pleasure it would give her to make him really love her,\n",
      "become quite mad about her. But again she was unwilling to pay the\n",
      "price. She argued that this was merely due to the persistence of the\n",
      "solitary ideal; and refused to face the cowardice that lurked in the\n",
      "bottom of her soul. Heroic in every other development of her highly bred\n",
      "character, she had all the secret fear and antagonism of her sex for the\n",
      "other, a profound resentment of the male instinct for possession, and\n",
      "the deeper terror that what Gwynne might find would eventually make her\n",
      "wholly his. Life had given her a deep surface; the depths below it sent\n",
      "up rare vibrations; and her mind was seldom unoccupied. She could add\n",
      "layer upon layer of evasions and subtleties with no prospect of a rude\n",
      "disturbance; and when the wind ceased for a time she tramped over the\n",
      "hills. But she missed Gwynne increasingly, wondered that he did not\n",
      "brave the elements and come out to her; finally felt herself shamefully\n",
      "neglected, and would not answer his occasional telephone queries as to\n",
      "her well-being.\n",
      "II\n",
      "Three days of floundering through the mud between Lumalitas and\n",
      "Rosewater exhausted Gwynne's patience, and he engaged a furnished suite\n",
      "of rooms on Main Street, moved in his law library, Imura Kisaburo\n",
      "Hinomoto, and several easy-chairs, invested in a red wall-paper for his\n",
      "sitting-room, and was immediately so comfortable, and so relieved to be\n",
      "rid of his dripping sighing trees and flooded valley, that he was almost\n",
      "happy. As he looked down from his window upon the slope of the street\n",
      "crowded with muddy wagons and men in oil-skins and high rubber boots, he\n",
      "recalled the ironical picture Isabel had drawn, that memorable night at\n",
      "Capheaton, of his own future appearance; and as he could not ride out to\n",
      "Old Inn in any other garb, an excess of vanity deterred him from going\n",
      "at all. To be sure he could drive out in a closed surrey, but he would\n",
      "have felt equally ridiculous, and Isabel, beyond doubt, would scorn him.\n",
      "Better let her think him indifferent for a while; it might do her good.\n",
      "He could save himself from discourtesy by telephoning occasionally, and,\n",
      "for the matter of that, the less he thought of her at present the\n",
      "better.\n",
      "For the first time he came intimately in contact with the men of\n",
      "Rosewater: \"leading citizens\" too busy to call upon him at Lumalitas, or\n",
      "to sit down in their places of business for a chat during the day, and\n",
      "too well trained to ask strangers home for dinner, were any hospitable\n",
      "instincts left in them. But they soon discovered that his rooms were\n",
      "very comfortable and inviting, his whiskey and tobacco \"above par.\" The\n",
      "homeless citizens of Rosewater, while their wives wrangled at bridge or\n",
      "five-hundred, fell into the habit of \"dropping in at Gwynne's,\" instead\n",
      "of going to the Lodge or the dingy back room of some saloon or lawyer's\n",
      "office. They were at liberty to take off their coats and put their feet\n",
      "on the railing surrounding the large iron stove that sat well out into\n",
      "the room. There were even spittoons for such as clung to the old\n",
      "tradition; and in a short time the large newly built, almost luxurious\n",
      "room took on somewhat of the character of that forum of an older time,\n",
      "the corner grocery. Judge Leslie seldom honored these assemblies, as he\n",
      "was tired at night and rejoiced in a comfortable home; nor did Tom\n",
      "Colton, whose domestic virtues were pronounced; but Mr. Wheaton came,\n",
      "and Mr. Haight, Mr. Boutts, and other solid business men old enough to\n",
      "be Gwynne's father; and they were all deeply interested in Rosewater\n",
      "first, State politics second, and national affairs once in four years;\n",
      "or oftener if there was any pyrotechnical departure from routine.\n",
      "European politics interested them not at all, and if they had any\n",
      "suspicion of Gwynne's real status, they were too accustomed to minding\n",
      "their own business to take any liberties with his reserve.\n",
      "But they were fully alive to the importance of his addition to the\n",
      "community. He was a large landholder, selling many small farms to\n",
      "acceptable persons; he spent money freely, buying everything he needed\n",
      "for his household and farm in Rosewater, instead of sending to the city;\n",
      "he was studying law with a view to practising in their midst; and now\n",
      "that Judge Leslie--who proclaimed him a marvel--was threatening to\n",
      "retire, his keen and cautious fellow-citizens needed nothing more than a\n",
      "man of first-class legal ability to take care of their great and varied\n",
      "interests and defend them against the corporation bogie. They found\n",
      "themselves hinting that he should engage in politics as well, when his\n",
      "probationary years were over.\n",
      "When Gwynne shrugged his shoulders one night and remarked bluntly that\n",
      "he had no desire to work with either of the California machines, and\n",
      "would unquestionably come a howling cropper if he worked against either,\n",
      "Mr. Wheaton answered with the nimbleness of a mind already made up, that\n",
      "he could be sent to Sacramento on an independent ticket--manipulated by\n",
      "the honest men of Rosewater--to fight such of the frauds and tyrannies\n",
      "as the State was suffering acutely from at the moment. During reform\n",
      "spasms the machines were practically powerless, and with the brilliant\n",
      "abilities he would be able to display as soon as he entered public life,\n",
      "and backed by a powerful influence, he could win his way to higher\n",
      "things before the wave subsided. They wanted a senator in Washington who\n",
      "was for his State first and himself next, even more than they wanted a\n",
      "lawyer; and for that matter he could serve their anti-corporation\n",
      "interests better there than here. Meanwhile he would have many\n",
      "opportunities to speak and show the stuff that was in him, draw converts\n",
      "to himself with his fiery eloquence and hard practicality, inculcate the\n",
      "desire for better things, and the necessity for reducing the influence\n",
      "of the army of petty professional politicians to a minimum, make of\n",
      "himself so central and inspiriting a figure that when his time came the\n",
      "best element of both parties throughout the State would form an\n",
      "independent body under his leadership.\n",
      "This was an alluring picture, but if Mr. Wheaton, who had had as little\n",
      "to do with politics as possible, was a bit of a dreamer, there was no\n",
      "question that his dreams were shared by more practical men at the\n",
      "present moment than for many years past; and that his theories were\n",
      "sound, however formidable the alert, resourceful, enormously capitalized\n",
      "army which stood between them and execution. His idol was Abraham\n",
      "Lincoln, and in consequence he \"banked\" on the good in human nature as a\n",
      "factor, which, in sudden recrudescences of indignant energy,\n",
      "accomplished revolutions of far greater moment than the overthrowing of\n",
      "political machines.\n",
      "Mr. Wheaton had launched forth upon one particularly stormy night when\n",
      "he happened to be Gwynne's only guest. The host, not to be outdone, was\n",
      "sitting with his feet on the railing of the stove, but as far from the\n",
      "spittoon as possible. He had listened to the long monologue, which\n",
      "involved a sketch of Lincoln's varied career, with more attention than\n",
      "might have been inferred from his half-closed eyes, and his pipe had\n",
      "gone out. It was only recently that any of his neighbors, barring Judge\n",
      "Leslie and Tom Colton, who shared his secret, had definitely proposed a\n",
      "political career to him, in other words divined his abilities and\n",
      "ambitions. But Mr. Wheaton had once been young and adventurous himself,\n",
      "and much if not all of his success in life was due to his shrewd\n",
      "divination of human nature. No man could drive a harder bargain than\n",
      "\"Wash\" Wheaton (he was named for the father of his country), but he had\n",
      "never been wanting in a vein of humorous sympathy, nor in a fair\n",
      "capacity for friendship as well as enmity.\n",
      "He raised his eyes from the coals and looked directly at Gwynne, who was\n",
      "relighting his pipe.\n",
      "\"I don't like Tom Colton,\" he said, abruptly. \"And it's not so much\n",
      "because he is the son of that old skinflint, neither. He is a little too\n",
      "much the product of the times--a sort of polished up descendant of that\n",
      "hoodlum element that terrorized San Francisco in the Seventies. He\n",
      "started out as a mere or'nary politician, but the Democratic Boss took\n",
      "him up and his ambitions are growing. What with the money he has and\n",
      "will inherit, and the devilish gall of him, he can play a deep game, and\n",
      "his chances of winning look a little too fair to suit a good many of us.\n",
      "He's nothing better than an anarchist, and without the excuse of the\n",
      "common anarchist--who, at the worst--or his own best--risks his life.\n",
      "Tom Colton and men of his stamp wouldn't risk the skin of their little\n",
      "fingers. All they do is to build a red-hot fire under the political\n",
      "caldron, stir it up with a big stick until it doesn't know where it is\n",
      "at or what it is made of, and then float into power on the steam. This\n",
      "has been one of the rottenest States in the Union for a good many years,\n",
      "and no wonder such men as Tom think they can about do as they please;\n",
      "but a good many are getting pretty damned tired of it, and there's a\n",
      "sort of reform mutter going on here and there that will gather and swell\n",
      "if skilfully manipulated. We've been talking you over, and have\n",
      "concluded to back you up for all we are worth as soon as you are\n",
      "ready--that is to say we would but for one drawback--your friendship\n",
      "with Colton.\"\n",
      "\"If you choose to call it that. I have told him in as plain English as\n",
      "he will ever hear what I think of his politics, and that if I ever enter\n",
      "public life myself I shall devote my energies to running him and his\n",
      "like out of it. He is too good-natured and too sure of himself--and his\n",
      "State!--to mind. Moreover, he has four years the start of me. It is\n",
      "possible that I shall go to Sacramento with, and even speak for, him;\n",
      "but he understands perfectly that I am only after experience, will\n",
      "advocate nothing I disapprove of--he actually has certain reforms in his\n",
      "political basket, and whatever may be his intention to compromise when\n",
      "he reaches Sacramento, I, at least, can advocate them in all sincerity;\n",
      "and further open the eyes of all these people to what they ought to want\n",
      "and to have. All this is perfectly understood between us. I, and the\n",
      "honest public clamoring for its rights, do not weigh a feather in the\n",
      "scale, in his opinion, against the might of organization.\"\n",
      "\"Very good. I suspicioned something of the sort. He can't corrupt you,\n",
      "and you couldn't get a better insight into corruption than through him;\n",
      "so fire away. What's your program, anyhow?\"\n",
      "\"It's too soon to make one--be sure that I am willing to return your\n",
      "confidence with my own\"--as the sharp china-blue eyes opposite\n",
      "contracted; \"but I can do little now except win the confidence of the\n",
      "farmers in this district and of men like yourself. But if a reform party\n",
      "does achieve power, if only for a term, the first thing for it to do is\n",
      "to overhaul the ballot system. Before we reformed ours we were as deep\n",
      "in the mire as yourselves. When the American voter is under the\n",
      "supervision of an honest judiciary, a general system of local reforms\n",
      "will follow as a matter of course.\"\n",
      "Mr. Wheaton sighed. \"You would have to begin with the judiciary. If you\n",
      "reformed them, and had any strength left, and then reformed the ballot\n",
      "in the manner of your own country, I guess you'd get about anything you\n",
      "wanted. But you'll need a tidal reform wave, I'm afraid. However, you\n",
      "never can tell what one year will bring forth in this country. On the\n",
      "other hand, the results of certain reforms, fought and died for, have\n",
      "done as much to make us pessimists as any of the immovable abuses. Take\n",
      "the question of Civil Service Reform, for instance. In the old days when\n",
      "you wanted to induce a man to give you the benefit of his abilities and\n",
      "influence during an election, you held out hopes of preferment, and he\n",
      "took your word if he knew your word was good, and worked with a decent\n",
      "sort of ambition--all things being relative. What happens now? Few find\n",
      "anything promising or attractive in the competitive examination. You ask\n",
      "a man--the professional politician he is now, sure enough--to help you\n",
      "get your candidate, or yourself, in, and what happens? The gentleman\n",
      "coolly demands, 'How much?' and holds out his hand. You fill it or he\n",
      "turns his back and walks off. There is just that much less of good left\n",
      "to appeal to in this particular brand of human nature. Ours is a much\n",
      "more complicated civilization than yours, Mr. Gwynne. You were dealing\n",
      "with Britishers only, in 1832. We are trying to digest the riffraff of\n",
      "the world, and can't do it, in spite of such incorrigible optimists as\n",
      "Judge Leslie. Immigrants in the first generation have just about as much\n",
      "feeling for the American flag as a chicken has for Rosewater. They look\n",
      "upon vote-selling as a legitimate way of improving their fortunes, and\n",
      "they are the easy prey of such agitators as Colton, because they had\n",
      "nothing in their own countries, and want the earth in this. Of course\n",
      "their children go to the public schools, and become Americans, but we\n",
      "always have the problem of fresh hordes to deal with. And new and\n",
      "old--it is easy to plant the weevil in their brains that the rich have\n",
      "corralled all the money, and the laborer--even in California, where he\n",
      "gets the highest wages paid on this earth--is a miserable victim, and\n",
      "entitled to all he doesn't make. They never remember that nearly every\n",
      "capitalist in the country has risen from their own ranks, and that their\n",
      "dreams are mainly occupied with doing the same. But you might as well\n",
      "talk to the trade-winds, especially with such men as Tom Colton stirring\n",
      "the caldron. 'Get rich quick; and selling votes is as good a starter as\n",
      "any.' There you have the moral sickness of the country in a nutshell.\n",
      "And few professions pay better than that of the politician. The pettiest\n",
      "division leader, who does the Boss's dirtiest work, and has fewer\n",
      "redeeming virtues than the midnight burglar, makes such a good thing out\n",
      "of it that the prettiest Salvation Army lass couldn't convince him of\n",
      "the error of his ways. And he enjoys himself. To hang around saloons,\n",
      "prize-fights, help out shyster lawyers with their tricks, and play the\n",
      "game hard during election times--that satisfies him until he sees a\n",
      "chance of stepping into a bigger pair of boots of the same make. But,\n",
      "thank God, there are more honest men out of politics than in. That is\n",
      "the trouble, but there they are, and it will be a part of your business\n",
      "to round them up. Well, I guess I've held forth long enough. I'll send\n",
      "you round a few volumes from my Lincoln library to-morrow. I always go\n",
      "to it when I lose my faith in human nature. Good-night.\"\n",
      "And he gathered up his long legs and went out.\n",

      "In his many talks with his friends in San Francisco, Gwynne had received\n",
      "practically the same suggestions. The lawyer who advised this group in\n",
      "its necessarily intermittent campaign against the San Francisco\n",
      "politicians was one of the ablest in the United States. He had offered\n",
      "Gwynne a place in his office, a 'courtesy partnership,' when he was\n",
      "ready to move to the city. But Gwynne deliberately remained undecided\n",
      "for the present, although half inclined to practise in the country for\n",
      "some years. If he could not have the inestimable education of the old\n",
      "days, when lawyers jogged about the country with the circuit judges for\n",
      "months at a time, he could at least get into close contact with the\n",
      "plain people in a manner that in a city would be practically impossible.\n",
      "Until the rains began, and after his definite understanding with Colton,\n",
      "he had, during his hours of exercise, formed the habit of \"dropping in\"\n",
      "upon the small farmers of his political district, under pretence of\n",
      "asking their advice; gauging and sowing. Upon the men that had bought\n",
      "land of him he was able to bestow many small favors, and his old\n",
      "experience with the tenantry of Capheaton gave him an instinctive\n",
      "knowledge of their wants that added to the sum of his popularity. To his\n",
      "inferiors he had never shown the arrogance of his nature, and he\n",
      "welcomed these small toilers as a substitute for his old tenants; for he\n",
      "had missed the poor that kept the sympathies quick--and, perhaps, gave\n",
      "richer shadows to life.\n",
      "His long lank American figure and slight resemblance to Hiram Otis, who\n",
      "had been an institution if not a favorite, his readiness to stand drinks\n",

      "combined with the subtle suggestion that he would not permit a liberty;\n",
      "a characteristic that every true man respects; his reputation for being\n",
      "\"dead straight,\" and his insistence upon receiving his just dues--\"all\n",
      "that was coming to him\"--in spite of the easy terms he made with several\n",
      "to whom he sold land; all this, in addition to the dignity of being the\n",
      "largest rancher in the county, and a law partner of Judge Leslie, had\n",
      "quickly made him a marked as well as a popular figure. Even his accent\n",
      "was unnoted in that State of many accents.\n",
      "He had thought out for himself all that Mr. Wheaton had suggested, and\n",
      "if he still had his moments of depression and disgust, and even of\n",
      "revolt, much of his old confidence was returning; although he sometimes\n",
      "reflected, with a sort of whimsical bitterness, upon the difficulty of\n",
      "sustaining an impression of innate greatness unaided by an occasional\n",
      "demonstration. But he had, at least, learned to see people merely as\n",
      "human beings without taking their shells into account; and he also\n",
      "realized that in those storms of spirit, which, at the time, he had\n",
      "deprecated as ebullitions from a too mercurial nature, he had developed\n",
      "more rapidly and precisely than many a man does by the exterior\n",
      "catastrophe. And impersonally his admiration for the land of one set of\n",
      "forefathers grew, although personally he remained cold. But he\n",
      "cultivated all sorts and conditions of men, and hopefully trained\n",
      "himself for the enthusiastic moment.\n",
      "There were even times when, surrounded by his Rosewater friends, with\n",
      "their lapses into quaint American speech and their intense localism, the\n",
      "old Otis blood stirred in him very strongly; he caught himself using\n",
      "phrases and figures that no doubt were an inheritance with his brain\n",
      "cells. When the walls and furnishings of his room were obscured by\n",
      "smoke, and there were half a dozen pairs of boots against his stove, it\n",
      "was not difficult to fancy himself back in the old corner grocery on a\n",
      "winter's night: his companions drinking apple cider, instead of rye\n",
      "whiskey, and the orator of the moment sitting, by preference, on a\n",

      "deserted as their huddled beaten gardens, stories Isabel had told him of\n",
      "the days of the Argonauts rose like ghosts in his brain, and he would\n",

      "mother promptly dispelled these visions.\n",
      "On the whole his time was too fully occupied to leave him more than\n",
      "stray moments for the subtler mood; but as day after day, finally week\n",
      "after week passed, with no prospect of fair weather, the monotony and\n",
      "confinement affected his nerves, he tired of the unrelieved\n",
      "companionship of men, and wished that Isabel would move in to Rosewater\n",
      "for the winter months. He rang her up, when this brilliant idea occurred\n",
      "to him, but was informed by Chuma that she was not in the house. On the\n",
      "following day he telephoned again, and learned that she slept, on the\n",
      "third that she was engaged in the delicate operation of extracting some\n",
      "deleterious substance from the crop of a valuable hen. Whereupon he\n",
      "swore vigorously, and vowed that he would forget her until the skies\n",
      "cleared. But \"the skies they were ashen and sober,\" and he caught\n",
      "himself dreaming over his \"Torts,\" or during one of Mr. Boutts's\n",
      "ecstatic visions of Rosewater with a great hotel in the style of the old\n",
      "Missions, and an electric railway. (Mr. Boutts, by-the-way, never\n",
      "elevated his feet to the railing of the stove, but always sat on the\n",
      "edge of his chair, a hand on either knee.) He took the train impulsively\n",
      "to San Francisco, one afternoon, and talked of reinforced concrete with\n",
      "his contractor, and San Francisco politics with Hofer. He even called\n",
      "upon several young ladies, who interested him less than ever, and\n",
      "returned to Rosewater at the end of four days with a sense of duties\n",
      "neglected and a slip in his self-mastery. This put him in such a bad\n",
      "humor that he directed his Asiatic to refuse him to the members of his\n",
      "informal Club, and wished he were back in San Francisco doing the town\n",
      "with Stone.\n",
      "III\n",
      "He was glowering into the open door of the stove and wondering why on\n",
      "earth he had not remained in town over Sunday at least, when he became\n",
      "aware that his noiseless Jap was standing at his elbow.\n",
      "\"What is it?\" he demanded, testily. \"I wish you would get a pair of\n",
      "creaky boots.\"\n",
      "\"A gentleman,\" replied the impervious Oriental.\n",
      "\"I told you I would not see anybody.\"\n",
      "\"But he has a card.\" It was not often that the cool even tones of Imura\n",
      "Kisabura Hinomoto fluctuated, but Gwynne detected a faint accent of\n",
      "respect. Somewhat surprised himself, he glanced at the card. It bore the\n",
      "name of one of the judges of one of the benches provided for by the\n",
      "constitutions of both nation and State. He had a summer home on the\n",
      "mountain opposite and relatives in Rosewater, so there was nothing\n",
      "remarkable in his being in the little town on a rainy winter Sunday.\n",
      "Nevertheless, Gwynne's instinct of caution, more active than usual\n",
      "during the past year, stirred sharply.\n",
      "\"Show him in,\" he said. \"And bring the whiskey--both Rye and Scotch.\"\n",
      "This was the most perfect specimen of the bluff, hearty, breezy, almost\n",
      "ingenuous Westerner that Gwynne had encountered. The judge, who had been\n",
      "relieved of his hat and overcoat by the admirable Imura, advanced with\n",
      "both hands outstretched, and Gwynne could do no less than surrender\n",
      "his, although he had never fancied any one less. The judge was a big man\n",
      "with a round jolly face, set with a sensual mouth, a pendulous nose, and\n",
      "merry twinkling eyes. Although possibly no more than fifty-five years of\n",
      "age, the baldness of his head had amplified the common noble domelike\n",
      "American brow: behind which Gwynne had so often groped and found\n",
      "nothing. This man was indubitably clever, and to a less educated eye\n",
      "than Gwynne's his face would appeal and fascinate. His magnetism was\n",
      "superlative.\n",
      "\"My dear Mr. Gwynne!\" he exclaimed. \"Believe me when I say that this is\n",
      "one of the most satisfactory moments of my life. I was forced to come to\n",
      "this God-forsaken hole last night, and had it not been for you I should\n",
      "have taken the morning train back to the city. But when I heard that you\n",
      "were in town--you were pointed out to me as we both left the train--I\n",
      "knew that my opportunity had come. And--my dear young gentleman--I throw\n",
      "away no opportunities; I throw away no opportunities.\"\n",
      "By this time Gwynne had steered him into the largest of the chairs, and\n",
      "offered him his choice of the whiskies. The judge, after an instant's\n",
      "hesitation, accepted the Scotch; and Gwynne felt that he had a tactful\n",
      "and dangerous man to deal with.\n",
      "\"Excellent!\" exclaimed the judge, and he smacked his lips. He inhaled\n",
      "the aroma of the cigar voluptuously. \"But my dear old friend, Judge\n",
      "Leslie, whom I ran in to see for a few moments this morning, told\n",
      "me--with his customary humor--that you were as remarkable for the\n",
      "superior quality of your whiskey and tobacco as for the many personal\n",
      "qualities that have so rapidly endeared you to the citizens of\n",
      "Rosewater.\"\n",
      "\"Thanks,\" said Gwynne.\n",
      "The judge changed his tactics instantly. \"I cannot beat about in the\n",
      "dark and merely turn myself loose in pleasant generalities, Mr. Gwynne,\"\n",
      "he said, gravely. \"I am going to tell you at once that I am positive you\n",
      "are Elton Gwynne. Judge Leslie would give me no satisfaction this\n",
      "morning, but I needed none. I happened to be employed in old Colton's\n",
      "bank in my younger days--as secretary--and although that was a long time\n",
      "ago--a long time ago!--it came back to me, when I began to hear so much\n",
      "about our new rancher, that his full name was John Elton Cecil Gwynne,\n",
      "and that he was the only son of his mother. Or--if impressions are\n",
      "confused after so long an interval--I may have gathered the last fact\n",
      "from James Otis, whom I knew very well. He and Hi, indeed, I may\n",
      "honestly say, were among my few intimate friends, despite some disparity\n",
      "in years. So, I have a double interest and, I modestly hope, claim upon\n",
      "you. The former at least has been accentuated since yesterday, when your\n",
      "likeness to Hi struck me very painfully. You are a vast improvement, I\n",
      "grant, for Hi was as ugly as mud and as cross as two sticks, but the\n",
      "resemblance is acute, odd as it may appear. Those things are very\n",
      "subtle, very subtle.\"\n",
      "Gwynne had heard the keys of his secret weakness tinkle for a full bar,\n",
      "but while it improved his humor it did not cloud his judgment, and he\n",
      "applied himself to finding out the purpose of the man's visit.\n",
      "\"I regret very much that I have come too late to know any of my male\n",
      "relatives,\" he said, affably. \"Hiram Otis, from all I hear, was an able\n",
      "man, if somewhat soured, and his unfortunate brother one of the most\n",
      "brilliant lawyers of his day. Terrible thing, this reckless drinking in\n",
      "San Francisco. I was told yesterday that when--a few years ago--an\n",
      "editor was sent out from New York to assume charge of one of your most\n",
      "flourishing dailies, he made the entire staff go down to Los Gatos and\n",
      "take the Keeley cure. Then, for a time, he had _relays_ of sober men, at\n",
      "least, but until then he had felt himself a lonely Philistine--besides\n",
      "taking a hand in every department of the 'shop,' even setting type at\n",
      "times. But it's a fascinating old town, all the same. Too fascinating, I\n",
      "fear.\" And he managed to fetch a remorseful sigh.\n",
      "The judge, who had laughed heartily at the anecdote, dismissed his\n",
      "twinkle for a moment, and looked at the young man with concern.\n",
      "\"For God's sake,\" he said, softly, \"don't tell me that you have\n",
      "inherited that microbe.\"\n",
      "\"Oh no, indeed!\" said Gwynne, cheerfully. \"I never could take to drink\n",
      "now--a man's character is pretty well formed at thirty-two, I fancy, and\n",
      "I scarcely ever touch spirits when alone--prefer the lighter wines.\n",
      "Only, as San Francisco is so convivial, one naturally imbibes a good\n",
      "deal, especially with friends addicted to the 'cocktail route'--and I am\n",
      "afraid I shall have to give up the city for the present and stick to\n",
      "work.\"\n",
      "\"The judge tells me that your legal powers are really amazing--that you\n",
      "have accumulated more law in four months--\"\n",
      "\"Tut! Tut!\" cried Gwynne, springing to his feet and reaching the table\n",
      "in a stride. \"Have some more whiskey, judge. And don't flatter me any\n",
      "more. I am afraid that vanity is my besetting weakness--\"\n",
      "\"Thank God it is not the other!\" said the older man, fervently. \"And\n",
      "vanity keeps the heart younger than anything I know of. Lose the power\n",
      "of being tickled by a compliment and inflated by success, and you lose\n",
      "the salt of life. But I am delighted that you have taken to the law. I\n",
      "know your English career like a book, and although I do not pretend even\n",
      "to guess at the motives which induced you to fling aside not only the\n",
      "most promising career in England, but one of the noblest of her titles,\n",
      "I may say, sir--and I may speak for my fellow-citizens, the whole\n",
      "million of them--I am deeply flattered, and gratified, that, whatever\n",
      "your motive, which could only be an honorable one, you have chosen this\n",
      "fair State as the theatre of your future triumphs. I hope I shall see\n",
      "you beside me on the bench--unless, to be sure, you have higher\n",
      "ambitions than the mere practice of law.\"\n",
      "\"The first men in the country have been lawyers,\" said Gwynne, politely.\n",
      "\"Why aspire higher?\"\n",
      "\"Why, indeed? But I think you will. The law frequently leads either to\n",
      "one of the benches or into the more active field of politics. And\n",
      "you--with your enormous energies--you will never be content with the\n",
      "law, pure and simple, no matter how brilliant a reputation you might\n",
      "achieve.\"\n",
      "\"But honest lawyers are so rare!\" exclaimed Gwynne, boyishly. \"I do\n",
      "believe I should be an honest one. That, at least, is the intention I\n",
      "have set beside my ambition. I am ambitious, judge, as no doubt you have\n",
      "divined, and the prospect of being shelved among the lords sickened me.\n",
      "I wanted to make a career for myself, so cut the whole business and came\n",
      "here where my American properties were. Besides, as it happened, I\n",
      "inherited practically nothing with which to keep up my English estates.\n",
      "There! You have my reasons, judge, and you are welcome to them. Titles\n",
      "without money are mere embarrassments. Still, I really should have left,\n",
      "had it been otherwise--I am certain I should. I never could stand the\n",
      "inaction of the Upper House. Nor do I care for those compensatory honors\n",
      "that my position and family influence might have secured for me. And now\n",
      "I feel more the American every day. I have even grown keen on making\n",
      "money--which I rather disdained at home; for the matter of that, thought\n",
      "little about it. You may not know that I am--in partnership, as it were,\n",
      "with my mother and cousin--putting up a large Class A building in San\n",
      "Francisco?\"\n",
      "He inferred that there was little about him the judge did not know, but\n",
      "accepted the interested \"Ah!\" and rhapsodized over his new interests.\n",
      "The Judge listened with a benignant smile and a twinkling eye, every\n",
      "once in a while giving the tip of his long fleshy nose an abrupt shove,\n",
      "as if it impeded his breathing.\n",
      "\"Just so!\" he exclaimed. \"Just so! It is the Otis blood. No better\n",
      "pioneer blood in the State. Jim was the wild one. The others were as\n",
      "steady as rocks. Their father and grandfather--your ancestors,\n",
      "sir--helped to make this great State what it is. Their names will always\n",
      "be honored in the annals of California. Terrible pity Jim and Hi got\n",
      "away with so much. If they'd hung on as your mother and her mother did,\n",
      "Miss Isabel would be one of the heiresses. But she seems able to take\n",
      "care of herself, and with that face and form, I guess she can redeem her\n",
      "fortunes any way she chooses. I hear that young Harry Hofer can't talk\n",
      "of anything else.\"\n",
      "Gwynne wondered if this were what the judge had come for, but\n",
      "exonerated him, concluding that he was merely rambling on in the hope of\n",
      "an opening.\n",
      "\"No doubt!\" he said, heartily. \"Miss Otis could marry any one she\n",
      "pleased. One of the best titles in England was hers for the asking,\n",
      "by-the-way. But like myself she is too good an American--shall I say\n",
      "Californian?--to live anywhere but here. She is immensely successful\n",
      "with her chickens, and we shall all make money on this new deal--I am\n",
      "certain of that.\"\n",
      "\"No doubt, no doubt. Things are booming in San Francisco. You'll get a\n",
      "huge rent from a building of that size--in time. Pity it has to be\n",
      "divided among three of you. And there will be a big mortgage to pay off\n",
      "first, I suppose; and it is in a very precarious district, a very\n",
      "precarious district.\" And once more the twinkle retired and he gazed\n",
      "dreamily at the fire.\n",
      "\"Oh, even golden apples have to ripen. And I have taken every precaution\n",
      "against fires. Have some more whiskey, Judge.\"\n",
      "\"Don't care if I do.\" Gwynne knew that the Scotch scalded a throat\n",
      "caressed these many years with the oily rye, and put as little seltzer\n",
      "in it as he dared. But the judge sipped it heroically. Suddenly the\n",
      "twinkle danced back to his eye as he turned it upon Gwynne.\n",
      "\"You can't delude me!\" he cried. \"You can't, sir. I know you intend to\n",
      "go in for politics. Nothing else would ever satisfy your genius. Own up,\n",
      "now.\"\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Gwynne, modestly. \"I have thought of it. After my five\n",
      "years are up, of course--makes one feel rather like a convict. Meanwhile\n",
      "I can make some headway with the law: or, shall I say, build up a\n",
      "reputation that may be useful to me when I am able to run for office.\"\n",
      "\"Ah! Just so! Great pity you were ever discharged from your American\n",
      "indigenate. Then one year in California would settle the matter. Which\n",
      "of our parties makes the strongest appeal to you?\"\n",
      "Gwynne's eyes had contracted and he was staring at the stove. But his\n",
      "abstraction was too brief to be noticed, and he answered in a\n",
      "confidential tone, \"Well, Judge, to tell you the truth--\" And then he\n",
      "stopped and laughed.\n",
      "\"I see. You think one is about as bad as the other.\"\n",
      "\"Well, I am afraid that is it.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, my boy, they're not nearly as bad as they are made out to be--our\n",
      "American politics. Judge Leslie is dotty on that subject, and so are a\n",
      "good many of the other old fossils of Rosewater. I don't say but that\n",
      "San Francisco would be the better for a good spring cleaning, but the\n",
      "State's not nearly so bad as it's painted, not nearly so bad as it's\n",
      "painted.\"\n",
      "He delivered his repeated phrases with an unctuous indulgent roll that\n",
      "made Gwynne long to grind his teeth. But the prospective American merely\n",
      "raised an interrogative eyebrow. \"I don't hear much good in any\n",
      "direction,\" he murmured.\n",
      "\"Of course, I can understand that you have seen through Tom Colton, and\n",
      "that he has appalled you as much as the fossils. He's in a hurry, and if\n",
      "he isn't mighty careful the machine will throw him down. For all his\n",
      "affected simplicity he's too fond of the limelight: loves to see his\n",
      "name in print; and when he makes a donation to a charity or an\n",
      "improvement scheme he uses up all the fireworks in the State.\"\n",
      "\"I was under the impression that he was in high favor with the district\n",
      "Boss--\"\n",
      "\"The district Boss is getting old, and Tom, one way or another, has\n",
      "acquired a great influence over him; but I happen to know that he\n",
      "doesn't stand any too well with the State Democratic Boss.\"\n",
      "\"If Tom were really earnest in his reforms, really had the interest of\n",
      "the common people at heart--although I never saw common people so well\n",
      "off in my life--but the point is that if Tom were really sincere he\n",
      "might form an independent party.\"\n",
      "\"Well, he can. It won't do him any good. It wouldn't do even you any\n",
      "good to work up a reform party, and your abilities are to his as a\n",
      "thousand to one. In fact a man like yourself would have far less chance.\n",
      "They would let Tom amuse himself, but they would find you really\n",
      "dangerous, and the upshot would be that the two parties would unite and\n",
      "crush you. Crush you flat. You might be a George Washington, Alexander\n",
      "Hamilton, and Abraham Lincoln rolled into one, and you would emerge from\n",
      "the swift and simultaneous impact of those two cast-iron walls flatter\n",
      "than the sole of your boot. Even if you made a good running on a reform\n",
      "wave, so much the worse. Reform waves merely serve the purpose of making\n",
      "some poor devil conspicuous and recklessly optimistic, then subside and\n",
      "leave him high and dry--at the mercy of the ever-recuperating machine.\n",
      "It's enough to make a man wish he'd never been born. I've seen it more\n",
      "than once. There's only one of two results. They are either so disgusted\n",
      "with politics that they stay out of them for the rest of their lives, or\n",
      "they pick themselves up and make a bolt for the machine they think most\n",
      "likely to give them a career. Look at some of our most illustrious\n",
      "incumbents. Great bluff on the outside--which the machine don't mind\n",
      "one little bit--and the best sort of a party man inside; walking a\n",
      "chalked line with no rebellious wings on his feet. Wings don't grow on\n",
      "clay. But they are right, Mr. Gwynne, and not because they are wrong,\n",
      "either. In this great country organization is absolutely essential, and\n",
      "in all vast complicated organizations some chicanery will creep in. But\n",
      "take them all in all, American politics are not half as bad as they are\n",
      "painted, not half as bad as they are painted.\"\n",
      "\"Well, that is a relief. You certainly should know. But what of the\n",
      "great corporations that rule this State--as well as the country? The\n",
      "State Democratic or Republican Boss is president or treasurer of one of\n",
      "them, is he not? I haven't taken the trouble to be very specific as yet.\n",
      "My time is so far off. Of course I do not need to be told that\n",
      "organizations, trusts, or whatever you like to call them, are\n",
      "inevitable--because they are in the line of progress; and unabused, they\n",
      "would be as much to the advancement of the individual as of the country.\n",
      "But they have been abused, from all I can make out--quite shockingly. I\n",
      "am taking the course on 'The Law of Corporations' at the University,\n",
      "partly because I want to understand so vital a question as thoroughly as\n",
      "possible--and partly--well--at least, I fancied I should--for a\n",
      "time--for what money there might be in it--But really!\"\n",
      "\"Oh, I don't say that some trusts are not reprehensible, and the sooner\n",
      "they are exposed the better. But they are sensational cases. The\n",
      "majority of the great complex aggregations of capital are monuments to\n",
      "American genius and progress; I am sure that if you waste any time on\n",
      "the yellow press you know how to discount it. Some of even the best of\n",
      "the trusts may have swollen to a size that renders them practically\n",
      "unmanageable, as well as injudiciously provocative of much jealousy and\n",
      "unrest. But the principle is sound, as you have admitted, and the great\n",
      "law of adjustment will correct all that is undesirable, and in a very\n",
      "few years. Meanwhile, get rich yourself, Mr. Gwynne. I'm delighted to\n",
      "learn that corporation law has appealed to you so strongly, for the\n",
      "money is there. I'm glad I came. I'd like to do one of your blood a good\n",
      "turn, to say nothing of yourself. Perfect yourself in corporation law\n",
      "and Leslie says you accumulate more rapidly than any hundred ordinarily\n",
      "well-equipped men one might name--and I can put you in the way of\n",
      "clearing a hundred thousand a year.\"\n",
      "\"_Could_ you?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, sir. What the great corporations want, and want badly, even with\n",
      "all the good legal talent they've got, is an attorney of extraordinary\n",
      "abilities, and this you have. I understand that the legal luminary of\n",
      "that reform set in San Francisco has offered to take you into his\n",
      "office. That's about as great a compliment as even you could have, but\n",
      "there's nothing in it. They're playing a losing game. They ought to win,\n",
      "but they won't. The San Francisco Boss may be what we elegantly term a\n",
      "shyster lawyer, but there never was as clever a one; and there's no\n",
      "trick he doesn't know. He'll beat them at every turn. You'd only make\n",
      "one more of that estimable Don Quixote band. Don't waste your youth.\n",
      "Study corporation law with all your might and main, and _I'll_ place you\n",
      "where you'll make a big income from the start--and it'll grow bigger\n",
      "every year. Then when your turn comes to vote and run for office--why,\n",
      "the whole field will be open to you to pick and choose from.\n",
      "Corporations are not ungrateful, and with a mighty one behind you, I\n",
      "guess you wouldn't whistle for anything, long.\"\n",
      "Gwynne regarded the thin sole of his house shoe with so rueful a\n",
      "countenance that the judge laughed outright. \"Have you really had\n",
      "thoughts of working up a reform party?\" he cried, the dancing imps in\n",
      "his eyes almost escaping.\n",
      "\"Well, I may have dreamed a bit that way. You see, I come of a family of\n",
      "reformers.\" And he gave the judge a rapid sketch of the part his English\n",
      "forefathers had played in the great reform acts of their country. The\n",
      "judge nodded sympathetically.\n",
      "\"Just so. I understand your point of view perfectly. Perfectly. But\n",
      "those great movements in England are matched here by spasms only. This\n",
      "country is too big and too heterogeneous. Don't set yourself between two\n",
      "cast-iron walls, Mr. Gwynne, because when they do get a concerted move\n",
      "on, they fly like hell. Join either of the parties, and you will find\n",
      "not only that it is not half as bad as it is painted, but that it\n",
      "accomplishes far more good than harm, many real reforms, that are\n",
      "systematically ignored by the press.\"\n",
      "\"I thought you said that reforms were impossible in this country.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, bless my soul, no. That would mean that we were going straight to\n",
      "the dogs. Reforms are going on every minute. The country is more\n",
      "tolerable and civilized every decade. What I mean is that no reform can\n",
      "be accomplished until the time is ripe for it. That is the reason why\n",
      "our spasms amount to nothing. They are always premature. But if you\n",
      "really want to do this country a service throw in your lot with the\n",
      "regulars. You would always be an influence for good, and when you saw\n",
      "the first opening for the correction of some crying abuse, you would\n",
      "have powerful machinery at hand to work with. What you want to do, Mr.\n",
      "Gwynne, is to become a powerful factor in the machine, not waste your\n",
      "time on windmills.\"\n",
      "\"Which machine?\" asked Gwynne, ingenuously. \"I don't fancy I could ever\n",
      "make up my mind. They seem precisely alike to me.\"\n",
      "\"Well,\" said the judge, slowly, although he brushed the tip of his nose\n",
      "aside with more violence than usual. \"I don't like advising,\n",
      "particularly a young man of your distinguished abilities and\n",
      "achievements. But I really think I am better able to advise you than\n",
      "Leslie, and certainly every man of us should feel a sense of\n",
      "responsibility to the old Otis--and Adams!--blood. I will say frankly\n",
      "that in your place I should join the party that owns this State--and\n",
      "shows no signs of letting go; in other words, the Republican. I can well\n",
      "understand, that having been a Liberal--and to the extent of renouncing\n",
      "your titles!--the Democratic would appeal to you. But don't waste your\n",
      "time, Mr. Gwynne. You are thirty-two. You don't want to throw away the\n",
      "next ten years on a losing game, and then, tired out, arrive nowhere.\n",
      "You would fight so hard that all your energies would be second-rate by\n",
      "that time. You want to begin right now and swim with the tide. Nurse\n",
      "your great energies for the exactions of the victorious career. You'll\n",
      "need them. And need them fresh.\"\n",
      "\"That sounds like good advice, but the whole political game appals me\n",
      "when I consider that it will be six years before I can even run for the\n",
      "House of Representatives--\"\n",
      "\"True! True! Pity your parents didn't lose you. But everything turns\n",
      "out for the best. Meanwhile, you can make name and fortune as a\n",
      "corporation lawyer. And you can't have too much money in this world,\n",
      "sir. You can't have too much money in this world.\"\n",
      "It was on the tip of Gwynne's tongue to ask him bluntly what corporation\n",
      "he had in mind, but not only did his already boiling humor recoil from\n",
      "the indignity of a deliberately worded bribe, but he doubted if it would\n",
      "be proffered so early in the game. He had a very clever man to deal\n",
      "with; it was not likely he would make the mistake of a direct approach.\n",
      "Gwynne flattered himself that he looked as ingenuous as Tom Colton, but\n",
      "as he had seen through the complacent judge, it was possible that the\n",
      "judge might entertain suspicions of a man with his reputation. He was\n",
      "glad he had not spoken when his visitor rose abruptly to his feet.\n",
      "\"Bless my soul!\" he exclaimed. \"I shall miss my train if I don't hurry.\n",
      "And heaven forbid that I spend another night in this mud-hole. My\n",
      "address is on my card--when do you come down again?\"\n",
      "\"There is a lecture at Berkeley on Wednesday--\"\n",
      "\"Good! Now, you will dine with me next Wednesday night--and I hope on\n",
      "many other nights. We must have several long talks--and all about your\n",
      "future, young man. I am too old to talk about my own, but I remember\n",
      "what I was at your age. Tactful, hey? But no,\" dropping his voice\n",
      "gravely. \"I want to help you. And I can. Whatever branch of the law you\n",
      "specialize upon, you must leave Rosewater and come to San Francisco. I\n",
      "can place you in an office--even should you decide upon general\n",
      "practice--that will carry you swifter and further than our reform friend\n",

      "talk of all that later. I must hasten.\"\n",
      "Gwynne escorted him to the head of the staircase, where he resisted an\n",
      "impulse to kick him down, then, after a hasty glance into the\n",
      "dictionary, encased himself in rubber and went up the hill to the home\n",
      "of Judge Leslie. He was to dine there, and it was but a quarter-past\n",
      "four, but what he had to say and ask would not keep for an hour and\n",
      "three-quarters.\n",
      "IV\n",
      "On his way to the house he decided that he could not confide even to\n",
      "Judge Leslie that he had been singled out as likely spoil by the\n",
      "\"grafters.\" No doubt that in a way it was a compliment to his abilities,\n",
      "this early-conceived determination to whisk him out of the reform field\n",
      "and engross his abilities, killing two birds with one stone. Probably he\n",
      "would be approached in a similar manner very often, until he became a\n",
      "definite quantity, and in time would grow accustomed to it; and callous.\n",
      "But at present he was hot and sickened, the more so as he felt that he\n",
      "had received a new impulse to believe in himself. These vast\n",
      "corporations--the railroad, street railways, lighting, and telephone\n",
      "companies, were the ones that dictated to San Francisco, and were\n",
      "supposed to have debauched the Board of Supervisors, all of them small\n",
      "laborers, elevated by the Boss to serve his ends--counted their capital\n",
      "by the millions; in one case, at least, by the hundred million. They had\n",
      "already bought much of the best talent in the country, and they wasted\n",
      "no time on the second-rate. Gwynne could easily guess in whose teeming\n",
      "and orderly brain the scheme to seduce and attach himself had been\n",
      "shaped, and, with the American contempt for the perspicacity of any\n",
      "foreigner, had selected this judge, with his breezy direct tactful\n",
      "manner, as certain to edge the newcomer into the fold. To Gwynne the\n",
      "only saving grace in the whole interview was that he had not been\n",
      "tempted. Had he been he should have felt utterly demoralized, disposed\n",
      "to take himself at the valuation of the business-like unsentimental\n",
      "brains in power.\n",
      "He found his judge awakening from a nap before his library fire and\n",
      "dusting the crumbs from his beard.\n",
      "\"This is an unexpected pleasure,\" the old gentleman began, then stopped\n",
      "short. \"What is the matter?\" he asked, anxiously. \"Sit down.\"\n",
      "\"What does indigenate mean?\"\n",
      "\"Why--a purely technical term for citizenship.\"\n",
      "\"A friend of yours called upon me to-day, on the strength of having\n",
      "known the Otises, and remarked that it was a pity I was ever discharged\n",
      "from my American indigenate.\"\n",
      "\"That you renounced American citizenship upon coming of age. It is a\n",
      "pity.\"\n",
      "\"But I remember doing no such thing. I did no such thing. I certainly\n",
      "should remember it.\"\n",
      "\"You mean that you made no formal act of renunciation of your American\n",
      "birthright, obtained no certificate of British nationality?\"\n",
      "\"I did nothing of the sort. It is possible that my father did it for\n",
      "me--\"\n",
      "\"Your father could do nothing.\" Judge Leslie was staring at him.\n",
      "Suddenly he laughed. \"You _are_ British! I am almost inclined to believe\n",
      "you hopeless. How did I get the impression that you had formally\n",
      "expatriated yourself? From Isabel, who, no doubt, woman-like, jumped at\n",
      "the conclusion--having known you when you were more British still. And\n",
      "you never brought up the subject--\"\n",
      "\"Don't regard me as wholly an idiot. I read the Constitution of the\n",
      "United States half a dozen times while making up my mind to come here,\n",
      "and it is not likely that Article XIV.--'All persons born in the United\n",
      "States, etc., are citizens of the United States, etc.'--escaped me. I\n",
      "consulted my solicitor, and he read me from some chapter on\n",
      "Expatriation, as plainly as may be, that the forfeiture of native\n",
      "citizenship was accomplished not only by a formal act of renunciation,\n",
      "but followed a long severance with the relations of the government under\n",
      "which the person was born, or--acceptance of service under a foreign\n",
      "government. Considering that I had left the United States when I was\n",
      "five weeks old, and had fought and bled for Great Britain, besides\n",
      "serving in her Parliament--where, of course I took my oath of\n",
      "allegiance--and that I had been an Englishman to every possible intent\n",
      "and purpose, even wearing my titles for some weeks, it seemed to me--and\n",
      "to my solicitor--that I would have rather a hard time obtaining an\n",
      "American passport.\"\n",
      "The judge nodded. \"Quite right. All the same, I can't understand why\n",
      "your father did not bring the question up when you attained your\n",
      "majority, or why you, an ardent Britisher, did not think of it\n",
      "yourself.\"\n",
      "\"You would understand if you lived among us for a few years. In the\n",
      "first place my being born in the United States was such a mere incident\n",
      "that it was rarely mentioned, and then in the most casual manner. I\n",
      "don't suppose my mother ever volunteered a piece of information in her\n",
      "life, and my father rarely gave a thought to any matter but sport. My\n",
      "grandfather probably disliked the idea--he detested America--at all\n",
      "events he never alluded to the subject, and was far too British to dream\n",
      "that the child of British parents could be other than British were he\n",
      "born in heaven itself. I don't think the matter had entered my mind for\n",
      "ten years, when the subject came up the first night of Isabel's visit to\n",
      "Capheaton--and I stupefied every one by announcing that I had been born\n",
      "in America; but otherwise it made no impression upon them. It is quite\n",
      "possible that had there been any prospect of my becoming the heir, when\n",
      "I reached my majority, some member of the family would have recalled the\n",
      "fact of my birthplace; but Zeal was well then, his wife was bearing\n",
      "children rapidly, there was every reason to suppose she would have half\n",
      "a dozen boys. Do you mean to say that I have never been an Englishman?\"\n",
      "\"Oh, you are all right as far as the British law goes. And you were a\n",
      "good and bona fide British subject for thirty years. Don't feel any\n",
      "discouragement on that score.\"\n",
      "\"Then am I an American citizen? Is there to be no long period of waiting\n",
      "and of comparative inaction?\"\n",
      "\"I am not so sure. There is no provision of the Constitution so open to\n",
      "various construction. And none has been so variously construed. I could\n",
      "cite a hundred instances--that is, I could read them to you to-morrow.\n",
      "But I recall two, and they are fair samples. One child, born in the\n",
      "United States, of French parents, returned to France, and after serving\n",
      "his term in the French army wished to become an American citizen, and\n",
      "obtained his passport without difficulty. A full-grown American citizen\n",
      "went to Mexico and fought for Maximilian, and lost not only his own\n",
      "citizenship, but that of his children, who had been born in the United\n",
      "States. There you are, and there you are again, as dear old Dickens\n",
      "would say. But I must think a minute.\" He transferred his gaze to the\n",
      "coals, and was silent for a few moments.\n",
      "\"There is a pretty strong case on both sides,\" he resumed, in a musing\n",
      "tone. \"You left this country when an infant, you practically forgot it,\n",
      "you entered the service of Great Britain heart and soul, and achieved\n",
      "high distinction. You inherited a title and wore it as a matter of\n",
      "course. For thirty years you never set foot on American soil, nor at any\n",
      "time demanded the protection of the United States, as you might easily\n",
      "have done in your foreign wanderings. There is hardly a doubt that if\n",
      "England had gone to war with us at any time during the last ten years\n",
      "and needed your services you would have given them. However, that\n",
      "contingency did not arise, so let it pass. But with an unsympathetic\n",
      "State Department and an active enemy or two, all the other points cited\n",
      "would make up as clear a case of voluntary expatriation as any on\n",
      "record. But there is a pretty good balance on the other side. You _were_\n",
      "born in the United States, you _did not_ renounce at any time your\n",
      "allegiance, you have the blood of two Presidents in your veins,\n",
      "and--here is the important point: you have been one of the heaviest\n",
      "tax-payers in California for thirty-two years. Now, as I have intimated,\n",
      "these expatriation cases have all been decided on their individual\n",
      "merits. I should advise you to go at once to Washington, and enlist the\n",
      "influence of the British Ambassador to get you personal and private\n",
      "interviews with the powers that be. Then plead your own case. One of two\n",
      "things will happen. Either there will be much hemming and hawing, and\n",
      "much virtuous and judicial weighing of your peculiar case, article by\n",
      "article, or the President himself will decide one way or another\n",
      "off-hand--he being what he is. For that reason I think it would be well\n",
      "to approach him by degrees, let him digest it a bit. He may be delighted\n",
      "that you have thrown over your titles and your brilliant and promising\n",
      "career to become an American citizen, invite you to take the oath of\n",
      "allegiance forthwith, and order the State Department to issue a\n",
      "passport. On the other hand he may fly off at a tangent and be\n",
      "righteously indignant that a man with the blood of the Otises and\n",
      "Adamses in him, who had the good-fortune to be born on American soil,\n",
      "hesitated a moment after reaching man's estate--more particularly that\n",
      "he never gave the matter a thought. Nothing could be more problematical.\n",
      "I wouldn't bet a twenty-dollar gold piece either way. But, I repeat, you\n",
      "must go yourself. Otherwise the affair would hang on interminably.\n",
      "Moreover, you must tell no one the object of your journey. Tom Colton\n",
      "would pull every wire within his reach, and he is no mean rival, to\n",
      "postpone your admission to citizenship, and so, I fancy, would others.\"\n",
      "He shot a keen glance at Gwynne. \"I think I know who your visitor was,\n",
      "to-day, and what he came to Rosewater for. That speech of yours, and its\n",
      "effect on the crowd, never escaped the attention of the party bosses,\n",
      "and of course you are a marked man in this small community--to say\n",
      "nothing of your intimacy with the reform set in town. The judge, who\n",
      "started somewhere in this neighborhood as a poor boy, rose from various\n",
      "minor situations to be the secretary of Colton's bank, saved his dimes\n",
      "and studied law. So far so good; the average self-made American. The law\n",
      "leads a good many of us into politics and it wasn't long leading him. He\n",
      "was an invaluable party man, with that bluff honest exterior, that\n",
      "superabundant magnetism, and that twinkling eye. The world always\n",
      "associates a fine upright nature with a twinkling eye. I have one myself\n",
      "and I believe that is the main reason why I have always been afraid to\n",
      "do wrong. Well, our friend got the bench when he wanted it, and he has\n",
      "been a mighty good friend to the corporation that put him there. And it\n",
      "has done well by him. He owns a fine house in San Francisco, entertains,\n",
      "goes into the best society, has visited Europe several times, and,\n",
      "although he is now rising sixty, continues to fool all but a few. He\n",
      "might climb higher and become a United States Senator, but the\n",
      "corporation finds him too useful here. He rather resents that, but they\n",
      "make the sacrifice worth his while. I can well conceive they have\n",
      "spotted you, and you may be sure there is little about you they don't\n",
      "know. Of course they have made up their minds you are erratic, and have\n",
      "not the least doubt that they can manipulate that loose screw. They have\n",
      "bought thousands, these ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----\n",
      "---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- (it was not often the judge swore, but\n",
      "when he did he took some time). Grafters, that are debauching the\n",
      "country and will soon make it impossible for an honest man to live; and\n",
      "although they will no doubt have the grace to approach you with less\n",
      "brutal directness than commonly, I knew that was what they were after\n",
      "the moment that old rascal began to talk to me this morning. He never\n",
      "fooled me. Well, we'll fool him. You go to Washington and get your\n",
      "passport, and if you can't hasten matters don't let an outsider know\n",
      "what you are after. Plunge into society and let them think you need a\n",
      "change from California. Of course you will give your real name. Cat's\n",
      "out, anyhow. Perhaps they will think you are on your way home to\n",
      "England. Flirt with the girls and be a frivolous young blood. The judge\n",
      "asked you to dinner, I suppose? I thought so. You would meet more than\n",
      "the judge; if not the first time, then the second and third. Write him a\n",
      "note, telling him you are obliged to go south to take a look at your\n",
      "mother's ranch. Then obey a sudden impulse and go East by the southern\n",
      "route. In Washington be seen as much with your ambassador as possible. I\n",
      "don't think these rascals will suspect, for they take for granted that\n",
      "you were duly 'discharged from your American indigenate'--I can hear\n",
      "him! If they did there would be the devil to pay, but I don't think they\n",
      "will. However, don't waste any time.\"\n",
      "Gwynne was staring at the fire, his inner being chaos, but he replied in\n",
      "a moment that he would start for Washington on the following day.\n",
      "V\n",
      "There had been no stormier night during the winter. Isabel's old house\n",
      "creaked and rattled and groaned like a ship in a whole gale, and the\n",
      "wind sent great waves of rain along the veranda. A northern window had\n",
      "been blown in and hastily patched. Although but nine o'clock the sky was\n",
      "as black as midnight. For several days there had been merely a quiet\n",
      "steady fall, but during the afternoon the northern rain belt had sent\n",
      "down another great storm and it had been rising ever since.\n",
      "Isabel, unable to go out, had washed her hair, and was still sitting on\n",
      "the hearth-rug, drying it, when she heard a shout outside, then the slam\n",
      "of a door at the back of the house, and voices in the kitchen. She was\n",
      "too warm and comfortable to be interested. If it were a tramp he was\n",
      "welcome to the shelter of the house; if a burglar there were two men to\n",
      "dispose of him, and her jewels were in a safe-deposit box in San\n",
      "Francisco. She loved a storm and had given herself up to one of those\n",
      "moods of pure delight in the present moment, although she had been in\n",
      "anything but a good-humor of late, and solitude had palled. But a raging\n",
      "storm, the sense of the absolute dominance of nature and the littleness\n",
      "of man, always exalted her. She knew that the old house was secure on\n",
      "its foundations, and, but that she loved comfort and warmth, she would\n",
      "have liked to be out on the marsh in a boat; tense with the\n",
      "difficulties of keeping the channel and avoiding the shoals and\n",
      "mud-banks obliterated by the risen waters. It amused her to imagine\n",
      "herself out there, while dwelling pleasurably, in a doubled\n",
      "consciousness, upon the warm red tints of her room. Her dreams were\n",
      "barely disturbed by the unknown interloper, but they were shattered a\n",
      "moment later by Gwynne's voice and rapid step in the hall.\n",
      "She had intended to greet him with a cool hauteur after his neglect of\n",
      "nearly a month, but she could not rise in time; and, enveloped in a mass\n",
      "of hair, spread over a yard of the floor, it was impossible to be\n",
      "dignified. So she resolved to be charming.\n",
      "\"I had to come in the back way like a tramp and leave my oil-skins in\n",
      "the kitchen,\" he announced, abruptly, as he entered. \"Don't get up. I\n",
      "have always wanted to see your hair down. So did Jimmy, I remember. Did\n",
      "he?\"\n",
      "\"Certainly not. Neither would you if you had not chosen such an\n",
      "extraordinary time to call. I am delighted to see you once more after\n",
      "all these years, but--what on earth possessed you?\" His eyes were\n",
      "glittering, although he had dropped his lids, and he did not sit down,\n",
      "but moved restlessly about the room.\n",
      "\"Your mother is much better,\" said Isabel, tentatively.\n",
      "\"Oh yes, and she is looking forward to her motor trip, and telephoned\n",
      "this morning that her room was a mass of flowers. I fancy she is a bit\n",
      "touched by so much kindness, for she has not been half decent to any one\n",
      "but the Trennahans.\"\n",
      "\"Does she say anything about returning to England? She had it in\n",
      "mind--just after the earthquake.\"\n",
      "\"She has made one or two casual allusions to her return, but she never\n",
      "plans far ahead--does what takes her fancy at the moment. But this life\n",
      "will never suit her. I imagine she will go before long. London is in her\n",
      "blood. Now that she can live properly--will have all she can, or ought\n",
      "to want, when the building is paying, there is no object in her\n",
      "remaining here.\"\n",
      "\"How goes the building?\"\n",
      "\"How can anything go in this infernal weather? The old shanties are\n",
      "down, and the contractor had a sort of tent erected and has done some\n",
      "work on the foundations. I should have come directly to California if I\n",
      "had had any idea of the money to be made by selling off my superfluous\n",
      "land and putting up that building. It might be finished, by this time.\n",
      "Why didn't you tell me?\"\n",
      "\"I am only remodelling my own brain on business lines by slow degrees,\n",
      "and no echo of this building fever reached me in Europe. You will\n",
      "remember that I did write, while you were wandering about America, that\n",
      "Mr. Colton suggested it for both of us. If I did not dwell on the\n",
      "subject it was because I had a feminine horror of the mortgage--and no\n",
      "idea that you were so keen on making money.\"\n",
      "\"I am thinking principally of my mother. When a woman has always had the\n",
      "world I doubt if she can live long out of it. San Francisco is all very\n",
      "well for the young and adventurous, and for those with a strong sense of\n",
      "the picturesque, but I can imagine that to a woman of her age and\n",
      "experience----Do you know--\" he burst out. \"I don't know where I am.\n",
      "What an extraordinary thing heredity is! I doubt if most people,\n",
      "although they would call that a platitude, realize that heredity is\n",
      "anything more than a telling word. There are times when I am sitting at\n",
      "my stove, surrounded by all those typical American men, who seldom\n",
      "mention a subject but politics and farming--for I tabu chickens--or the\n",
      "intensely local interests, more or less affected by politics,--there are\n",
      "times when I actually feel the nameless ambitious young fellow--not born\n",
      "in a log-cabin, perhaps, but next door to it--and endowed with that keen\n",
      "compact pioneer determination to stride straight to my goal, whether it\n",
      "is the White House or--well--the Presidency of a Trust Company. I\n",
      "forget--good God!--_Are_ those years behind me in England? I have caught\n",
      "myself wishing that I had kept a scrap-book like other idiots. It\n",
      "escapes my memory altogether at times, that I have but to take a steamer\n",
      "out of New York to reach the top of civilization again in less than a\n",
      "week.\"\n",
      "\"Perhaps it suggests itself when you remember that with the income you\n",
      "can command before long, life in England will be more worth while.\"\n",
      "\"That was as nasty a one as you ever gave me! No one knows better than\n",
      "yourself what brought me to America, and that those conditions cannot be\n",
      "altered by money. Could I not have had Julia Kaye's fortune? You need\n",
      "not be nasty again! You forget that not only was I in love with her--or\n",
      "thought I was--but could have given her the equivalent. She would be the\n",
      "last to claim that she was to pay too high a price, even with me thrown\n",
      "in. If you don't beg my pardon I'll leave the house.\"\n",
      "\"I beg your pardon,\" said Isabel, hastily. She was thrilled with\n",
      "curiosity; she had never seen him so nearly excited, with the exception\n",
      "of one memorable and painful moment. She fancied that she could see one\n",
      "of the barriers between them sway.\n",
      "\"It may be that this sudden prospect of wealth, or rather of a goodish\n",
      "income that would enable me to keep up a decent establishment in town,\n",
      "and a bit of a place somewhere in the hunting country, has upset my\n",
      "equilibrium, but it occurred to me this morning as I was splashing\n",
      "through the mud--I had to go out to the ranch--in fact it came over me\n",
      "with such a rush that I felt like Don Quixote, and every landmark looked\n",
      "like a windmill--what is England to-day but the very apex of\n",
      "civilization? The Mecca, the reward, of every man and woman with the\n",
      "breeding and the intelligence to appreciate it? The best of everything\n",
      "goes there, you have but to turn round to help yourself to an infinite\n",
      "variety--to be found piecemeal everywhere else on earth. And the very\n",
      "best is mine, by inheritance and personal effort. Why in thunder am I\n",
      "out here on this ragged edge of civilization struggling with almost\n",
      "primitive conditions?--elemental badness, sure enough! What is my\n",
      "object? Merely to bring about a set of conditions that exists in England\n",

      "enough.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, but I mean it. I will not hear of you riding back in this pitch\n",

      "night for romance, and you and I sparring like two prize-fighters! That\n",
      "is as far as we have ever got. If you would ever let me know\n",
      "you--sometimes I have an odd fancy that I can see a lamp burning in your\n",
      "breast, and that if ever I got at it, and searched all the nooks and\n",

      "\"I am afraid it is only a taper in a cup of oil. At all events it is not\n",

      "\"Nothing!\"\n",
      "\"Do you mean to tell me that you are literally contented with your life\n",

      "\"Future? You saw what that amounted to when you were in town--\"\n",

      "\"Well, I'm sick of the subject. I came to say good-bye for a time. I'm\n",

      "\"Very well.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, well, it would be beastly ungrateful in me not to. I have had a\n",
      "hint that, not having de-Americanized myself formally when I came of\n",
      "age, I may still be an American citizen. Judge Leslie has advised me to\n",
      "go to Washington and find out, and I am going. Are you really so\n",
      "interested?\"\n",
      "\"Oh yes,\" said Isabel, softly. \"I am interested! I have been afraid you\n",

      "allegiance to the United States--if that is sprung on me in\n",
      "Washington--I shall feel more like taking the next steamer for England\n",
      "and making my oaths there. It is a little too sudden.\"\n",

      "mantel-shelf, and replied, quietly:\n",
      "\"It will take some time for you to know whether you are in love again\n",

      "perhaps, shows how far gone I am. But precious little you know about\n",
      "men. Or yourself. If I kissed you this minute you would succumb--\"\n",
      "He turned suddenly and was down the hall and had slammed the kitchen\n",
      "door behind him before she realized that she was actually alone, that he\n",
      "meant to leave the house. For a moment she clutched the edge of the\n",
      "mantel-piece in a passion of relief and regret. Then her femininity was\n",
      "swept aside by her hospitable instinct and vehement fear. She ran down\n",
      "the hall and into the kitchen. But even his rain garments and boots were\n",
      "gone. She opened the back door and peered out into the inky darkness. A\n",
      "light was moving in the stable. The rain was falling in a flood and the\n",
      "wind almost drove her backward. But she gathered up her gown and ran as\n",
      "fast as she could make headway to the stable. He was alone, and\n",
      "tightening his horse's saddle-girths by the light of a dark lantern. He\n",
      "gave her a bare glance and went on with his work.\n",
      "\"You must not go!\" She was forced to scream. \"You shall not. Why, you\n",
      "are mad. The marsh--such conventionality is ridiculous. I refuse to\n",
      "recognize it.\"\n",
      "He rose to his feet and led his horse outside. But before he could vault\n",
      "to the saddle she caught his arm and dragged him backward. \"You shall\n",
      "not go! You shall not!\" She could hardly hear the sound of her voice.\n",
      "But she heard his, and there was nothing in either storm or darkness to\n",
      "blunt the sense of touch. For a moment she felt as if the whole had\n",
      "never been halved, as if they two were youth incarnate; and his arm was\n",
      "like vibrating iron along her back. She thought he was going to kiss her\n",
      "and dazedly moved her head towards him. But he cried into her ear\n",
      "instead:\n",
      "\"I stay if you marry me to-morrow.\"\n",
      "\"No, no, no!\" Her will sprang through her lips, and before it was beaten\n",
      "down again she saw a spark of light engulfed in the dark, and stood\n",
      "alone in the storm, wondering if the world had turned over.\n",
      "VI\n",
      "\"_Monday Morning._\n",
      "\"This is merely to announce that I survived the marsh, and that\n",
      "upon my return we will resume where we left off last night. E. G.\"\n",
      "Isabel received this note early in the morning. That night she had\n",
      "accepted an invitation of some weeks' standing, and was established in\n",
      "the old Yorba mansion on Nob Hill. She anathematized her cowardice, but\n",
      "solitude was beyond her endurance for the moment. She had made up her\n",
      "mind that she would not think of Gwynne at all, much less give herself\n",
      "opportunities to miss and desire him; and her will, reinforced by\n",
      "conditions, was strong enough at times to persuade her that she hated\n",
      "him.\n",
      "And there was nothing in the Trennahan household to try her nerves,\n",
      "everything to soothe them. Although the old buff walls and terrible\n",
      "carpets of Mrs. Yorba's day had gone long since and the house had been\n",
      "completely refurnished, it looked like a home, not a museum. Trennahan\n",
      "had taken his family to Europe many times, and they had brought back\n",
      "much that was rare and beautiful; but nothing stood out obtrusively, not\n",
      "even a color. They entertained constantly in a quiet way, and if\n",
      "Magdalena was far too Spanish to seek out the clever of all sets, and\n",
      "Trennahan too indifferent, at least Isabel met daily such of the _haute\n",
      "noblesse_ as were not completely fossilized, and many men that\n",
      "interested her well enough. Moreover, as Mrs. Trennahan now had a\n",
      "grown-up daughter, she was obliged to take her to the cotillons and\n",
      "other routs given under the merciless supervision of the Leader. Isabel\n",
      "accompanied her as a matter of course, and when she declined an\n",
      "invitation her guest was at liberty to go with the ever faithful Mrs.\n",
      "Hofer.\n",
      "For three weeks Isabel did little thinking. She went to the ranch once a\n",
      "week for the day only, spent an occasional hour with Lady Victoria. Even\n",
      "then she was barely reminded of Gwynne. She was busy during every moment\n",
      "while in the country, and her relative was no more communicative than of\n",
      "yore. Only once did Victoria remark casually, that, by a sort of poetic\n",
      "justice, Gwynne was detained in the south with a sprained ankle, and was\n",
      "hurling maledictions at fate from the classic shades of Santa Barbara.\n",
      "Isabel grudgingly admired the restraint with which he denied himself the\n",
      "possible solace of correspondence with herself, and it crossed her mind\n",
      "once or twice that the young man might have the understanding of women\n",
      "that proceeded from instinct, if not from study. But she deliberately\n",
      "dismissed him, and although his name was frequently mentioned in her\n",
      "presence, she soon ceased to turn cold, and forced him to flit with a\n",
      "hundred others across the surface of her mind.\n",
      "For the first time in her life she flirted desperately, and with others\n",
      "besides young Hofer. She was quite wickedly indifferent to consequences,\n",
      "and was inspired to woo the fickle goddess of popularity. The peace and\n",
      "charm and intellectual relief of the Trennahan home did much to modify\n",
      "her shrinking from realities, and the effort to please, and the\n",
      "abandonment to the purely frivolous instincts of youth, were the only\n",
      "aides her beauty needed to achieve that popularity she had abstractly\n",
      "desired the night Gwynne brought her the stars. She no longer desired it\n",
      "at all, but she disguised this fact, and reaped the reward.\n",
      "Moreover, although her analytical faculty slept in the darkest wing of\n",
      "her brain, the mere fact that she was stormily loved and desired by a\n",
      "man to whom she was powerfully attracted, that for a moment she had been\n",
      "awake and eager in his embrace, had warmed her blood and given her an\n",
      "insolent magnetism that she had never possessed before.\n",
      "Through Mr. Colton she received a formal request from Gwynne to dedicate\n",
      "the Otis Building--named in honor of the creator of the family\n",
      "fortunes--on the day the last of the foundation-stones was laid. In\n",
      "company with half a hundred other young people in automobiles, she\n",
      "astonished South of Market Street, one beautiful spring day--the spring\n",
      "was making desperate assaults upon the lingering winter--and amidst much\n",
      "mock solemnity and many cheers, deposited into the chiselled crypt of\n",
      "one of the great concrete blocks upon which the building would rest, a\n",
      "strong-box containing three of Concha Argueello's Baja California pearls,\n",
      "several family daguerreotypes, and the original deed of sale which had\n",
      "transferred the property from the city to the first James Otis. When the\n",
      "ceremony was over the contractor shook hands with her approvingly.\n",
      "\"That's as good a place as any for a deed of sale in this here town,\" he\n",
      "remarked. \"For no shake will ever budge them concrete pillars. They're\n",
      "down to bed-rock. And no fire'll ever crack them, neither. We'll begin\n",
      "on the steel frame to-morrow, and you must come down occasionally and\n",
      "cheer us up. It'll be worth it. The Otis's goin' to be the cock o' the\n",
      "walk. Better make up your mind to have them terra-cotta facings.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, they would not raise the rents, and would hardly be appreciated by\n",
      "their present neighbors,\" said Isabel, lightly. \"I am going to send you\n",
      "a bottle of champagne to-night, and you must drink to the health of The\n",
      "Otis.\"\n",
      "The man promised fervently that he would, and then after ordering beer\n",
      "from a neighboring saloon for the workmen, Isabel and her party motored\n",
      "out to the beach beyond the Cliff House, where a number of old\n",
      "street-cars had been converted into bath-houses, and disported\n",
      "themselves in the waves until it was time to rush home and make ready\n",
      "for the Mardi Gras ball.\n",
      "This yearly function was given in the Institute of Art on Nob Hill, the\n",
      "wooden Gothic mansion with bow-windows, erected in the Eighties by a\n",
      "railroad millionaire who had barely survived his nimble victorious\n",
      "assault upon Fortune. His widow had presented his \"monument\" to Art, and\n",
      "now its graceful flimsy walls housed much that was valuable in canvas\n",
      "and marble, and more that was worthless. Once a year, on the eve of\n",
      "Lent, Society gave a Mardi Gras ball, and such of the artists as were\n",
      "known to the elect decorated the rooms, and contributed certain\n",
      "surprises. This year, partly out of compliment to the Leader and Miss\n",
      "Otis, partly because the old Spanish spirit had been roaming through its\n",
      "ancient haunts of late, the interior of the mansion was hung with red\n",
      "and yellow. Isabel, in full Spanish costume, led the grand march with\n",
      "young Hofer, who was dressed as a toreador, and supported the jeers of\n",
      "his friends in the gallery with what fortitude he could summon: he was\n",
      "plump and pink and golden. The great room, surrounded with boxes draped\n",
      "with the colors of Spain and filled with women splendidly dressed and\n",
      "jewelled, was very gay and inspiring, and the masques flung confetti and\n",
      "had a squib for everybody with a salient characteristic. When the march\n",
      "finished, Isabel, who wore a half-mask of black satin, and her hair in\n",
      "two long braids plaited with gold tinsel, danced a Spanish dance by\n",
      "herself, alternating tambourine and castanets. She had practised it\n",
      "during the past week with a professional, and she gave it with all the\n",
      "graceful sexless abandon of those California girls, who, a hundred years\n",
      "before that night, were dancing out at the Presidio and Mission. She was\n",
      "the success of the evening as she had purposed to be, and went home with\n",
      "two proposals to her credit, and as gratified a vanity as ever\n",
      "titillated the nerves of an ambitious and heartless young flirt. It was\n",
      "not the first time that Isabel had deliberately elected to play a role\n",
      "and achieved so signal a triumph that she was beset with the doubt if\n",
      "she had not but just discovered herself. As she fell asleep in the dawn\n",
      "of Lent it was with the somewhat cynical reflection that perhaps she\n",
      "could make quite as great a success of the role of the statesman's wife\n",
      "were she to essay it.\n",
      "The roads were still in too muddy and broken a condition for the\n",
      "long-projected automobile trip, and the Trennahans had decided to hire a\n",
      "special car and journey to Mexico, spending some time in Southern\n",
      "California. They urged Isabel to go with them, but she was sure that she\n",
      "had had all the respite she needed, nor would she neglect her chickens\n",
      "any longer. In truth she said good-bye to the party, which included not\n",
      "only Lady Victoria, but several other congenial spirits, with a\n",
      "considerable equanimity. She was suddenly tired of them all and glad to\n",
      "go back to her solitudes.\n",
      "Although she did not return with that exuberance of joy, which, upon\n",
      "former occasions had made her feel like a long-prisoned nymph restored\n",
      "to her native woodland, still she was more than content to be at home\n",
      "again, and sat on her veranda until darkness closed the long evening.\n",
      "Every trace of the winter's madness had vanished. The marsh was high and\n",
      "red above the fallen waters, the hills were green, the trees budding,\n",
      "wild flowers were beginning to show their heads. The scene, until the\n",
      "last ray of twilight had gone, leaving that dark formlessness of a\n",
      "California night with its horrid suggestion, was almost as peaceful as\n",
      "England.\n",
      "For several days Isabel, from reaction after weeks of incessant gayety,\n",
      "and the heaviness of early spring, was too languid to find even her\n",
      "Leghorns interesting. She slept late, yawned through the day; and never\n",
      "had her hammock--swung on the porch at the beginning of\n",
      "spring--possessed so recurrent an attraction. At the same time she was\n",
      "conscious, under the physical inertia which had brought her mind to a\n",
      "standstill, that she avoided Rosewater lest she should be forced to talk\n",
      "of Gwynne. He was still in Santa Barbara, and it was likely that he\n",
      "would be persuaded to go with the Trennahans to Mexico. There was time\n",
      "enough to seek his passport, and Isabel could well imagine that his\n",
      "impatience was not uncontrollable. No doubt he understood by this time\n",
      "that he could expect no change in her, if indeed he had not dismissed\n",
      "the matter from his mind.\n",
      "She was rudely shaken out of her apathy by a long telegram from him,\n",
      "dated at El Paso:\n",
      "\"I have come this far with the Trennahans. Go on to Washington\n",
      "to-day. Expect me any time now. But should I be detained will you\n",
      "go over to the ranch occasionally? Use old power of attorney should\n",
      "occasion arise. Glad you made the running you wanted at last.\n",
      "Better order terra-cotta facings for The Otis. Am told that two\n",
      "other buildings will go up shortly in neighborhood. Quite fit\n",
      "again. E. G.\"\n",
      "The delight and relief this telegram induced, the subtle sensation of\n",
      "hope and flattery, not only routed torpidity, but lashed her into such a\n",
      "state of fury that she ran up to her bedroom and indulged in an attack\n",
      "of nerves. When it was over she faced the truth with the unshrinking\n",
      "clarity of vision she could summon at will. But if she was not as\n",
      "astonished as she thought she ought to be, she was no less angry, not\n",
      "only with herself, but with life for playing her such a trick. Less than\n",
      "ever did she want to marry, and cease to be wholly herself, to run the\n",
      "risk of disillusionment and weariness, and that ultimate philosophy\n",
      "which was no compensation for the atrophy and death of imagination. But\n",
      "no less did she turn appalled from the thought of a future without\n",
      "Gwynne. All her old vague plans were suddenly formless, and she felt\n",
      "that if she even faced the prospect of regarding the shifting beauties\n",
      "of the Rosewater marsh for the rest of her life, she would hate nature\n",
      "as much as she now hated her treacherous self. And none could divine\n",
      "better than she, that, present or dismissed, when a man has conquered a\n",
      "woman's invisible and indefensible part she might as well give him the\n",
      "rest. He is in control. She has lost her freedom for ever. So strong was\n",
      "the feeling of mental possession that Isabel glanced uneasily about the\n",
      "room, half-expecting to see the soul of Gwynne; wondering inconsequently\n",
      "if it would descend to notice that her eyes were red. But she vowed\n",
      "passionately that she would not marry him. If she had to be unhappy, far\n",
      "better unhappy alone and free, with some of her illusions undispelled.\n",
      "She had seen no married happiness that she envied, even where there was\n",
      "a fine measure of love and philosophy. Even Anabel had come to her one\n",
      "day in town, looking rather strained and worn, and, in the seclusion of\n",
      "Isabel's bedroom, had confessed that the constant exactions of a\n",
      "husband, three children, and migratory servants \"got on her nerves,\" and\n",
      "made her long for a change of any sort. \"And there are so many little\n",
      "odd jobs, in a house full of children,\" she had added, with a sigh. \"And\n",
      "they recur every day. You can no more get away from them than from your\n",
      "three meals; I never really have a moment I can call my own. Of course I\n",
      "am perfectly happy, but I do wish Tom were not in politics and would\n",
      "take me to Europe for a few years.\"\n",
      "And if Anabel was not happy--wholly happy--with her supreme capacity for\n",
      "the domestic life, how could she hope to endure the yoke? She with her\n",
      "impossible ideals and theories? Not that they were impossible; but to\n",
      "anticipate, in this world, the plane upon which the more highly endowed\n",
      "natures dared to hope they were to dwell in the next, absolute freedom\n",
      "was necessary. Isabel's theory of life--for women of her make--had not\n",
      "altered a whit, but the beckoning finger had lost its vigor. That left\n",
      "her with no material out of which to model a future for this\n",
      "plane--which, of course, was another triumph to the credit of the race.\n",
      "She knew that Gwynne had conquered, that she had really loved him, as\n",
      "soon as he had ceased to play upon her maternal instincts. She had\n",
      "casually assumed at the time that her interest in him was decreasing,\n",
      "but in this day of retrospect, she realized keenly that it had marked\n",
      "the opening of a new chapter. This was, perhaps, the most signal of\n",
      "Gwynne's victories, for the maternal tenderness for man means maternal\n",
      "dominance, a cool sense of superiority. Isabel was so conscious of\n",
      "Gwynne's mastery that she longed to kick him as she blushed to recall\n",
      "she had done once before. She rubbed her arms instinctively, as if she\n",
      "still felt the furious pressure of his fingers, and when the memory of\n",
      "another sort of pressure abruptly presented itself she hurriedly bathed\n",
      "her eyes and went out on her horse.\n",
      "VII\n",
      "For a week she was so moody and irascible that Abraham twice gave\n",
      "warning, Old Mac artfully took to his bed with rheumatism, and only the\n",
      "inexcitable Chuma was unconcerned. She rode her horse nearly to death,\n",
      "snubbed Anabel--whose children were down with the measles--over the\n",
      "telephone, and even boxed the ears of a dilatory hen. At the end of the\n",
      "week a sudden appreciation of her likeness to a cross old maid\n",
      "frightened her, and time and the weather completed the cure. Her\n",
      "ill-humor, which had scourged through every avenue of her being, took\n",
      "itself off so completely that it seemed to announce it had had enough of\n",
      "her and would return no more.\n",
      "And the spring came with a rush. The hills burst into buttercups, \"blue\n",
      "eyes,\" yellow and purple lupins, the heavy pungent gold-red poppy. The\n",
      "young green of weeping willows and pepper-trees looked indescribably\n",
      "delicate against the hard blue sky. Rosewater was a great park, all her\n",
      "little squares and gardens, and long rambling streets, set thick with\n",
      "camellias, roses, orange-trees heavy with fruit, immense acacia-trees\n",
      "loaded with fragrant yellow powdery blossoms. Main Street was clean\n",
      "again, and so were the farmers and their teams at the hitching-rails;\n",
      "the girls were beginning to wear white at church on Sunday, and to walk\n",
      "about without their hats. The great valley was as green as the hills,\n",
      "save where the earth had been turned, and one or two almond orchards\n",
      "were so pink they could be seen a mile away. It was spring in all its\n",
      "glory, without a taint of summer's heat, or a lingering chill of winter.\n",
      "In Isabel's garden were many old Castilian rose bushes, that for fifty\n",
      "years had covered themselves pink with the uninterrupted lustiness of\n",
      "youth; and their penetrating, yet chaste and elusive fragrance, combined\n",
      "with the rich heavy perfume of the acacia-tree beside the house, would\n",
      "have inspired a distiller and blender of scents. The birds sang as if\n",
      "possessed of a new message; and several of Isabel's prize roosters,\n",
      "tired of their old harems, flew over the wire-fences and strutted off in\n",
      "search of adventure, proclaiming their route by loud and boastful\n",
      "clamor. When they were captured by the unsympathetic Abe and restored to\n",
      "their excited ladies, they flew at and smacked them soundly, then tossed\n",
      "back their red combs and crowed with all their might: a paean to the ever\n",
      "conquering male.\n",
      "There were other flowers besides Castilian roses in Isabel's garden,\n",
      "haphazardly set out and cared for, but the more riotous and luxuriant\n",
      "for that. And all around her, save on the Leghorns' hills, was the gay\n",
      "delicate tapestry of the wild flowers. The marsh glittered like bronze\n",
      "in the sunlight. In the late afternoon it was as violet as the hills. In\n",
      "the evening afterglows it swam in as many colors as the Roman Campagna.\n",
      "At this hour the sky was often as pink as the almond orchards, melting\n",
      "above into a blue light but intense; while everything in its glow, the\n",
      "tall trees on the distant mountains, and the picturesque irregularities\n",
      "of the marsh-lands, seemed to lift up their heads and drink in the\n",
      "beauty until Isabel expected to see them reel.\n",
      "And the pagan intoxication of spring took as complete a possession of\n",
      "her. She sat under the long drooping yellow sprays of her acacia-tree,\n",
      "her lap full of the pink Castilian roses, and dreamed. No one could help\n",
      "being in love in the spring, she concluded, given a concrete\n",
      "inspiration; and far be it from any creature so close to nature as\n",
      "herself to attempt to stem that insidious musical scented tide. It was\n",
      "possible that Gwynne would not return, or returning, would flout her;\n",
      "she hardly cared. In fact so steeped was she in the pleasures of merely\n",
      "loving, in a sweet if somewhat halcyon passion, that she had no wish\n",
      "that the mood should be dispelled; and felt that she could ask nothing\n",
      "more than to spend the rest of her mortal life with a beautiful\n",
      "memory--like the aunt whose dust lay over the mountain in the convent\n",
      "yard. She knew that if Gwynne returned and demanded her, she should be\n",
      "tempted to marry him--she never went so far as to promise either him or\n",
      "herself the rounded chapter; but one of the strongest instincts of her\n",
      "nature was to squeeze the passing moment dry, jealously drink every drop\n",
      "of its juice. She had no intention of tormenting herself with\n",
      "problematical futures. Futures took care of themselves, anyhow.\n",
      "She was subconciously aware that she could conceive and portray a more\n",
      "extreme phase of emotion than this present evolution, but she\n",
      "deliberately avoided the phantasm. She was utterly, ideally, absurdly\n",
      "happy. Not for a moment did she desire the raw material, the concrete\n",
      "substance, to which all dreams owe their being. The wild pagan gladness\n",
      "of the wood-nymph, rejoicing in her freedom from the worries of common\n",
      "mortals, and in the vision of an undefined but absolute happiness, was\n",
      "enough for her. Sometimes, when walking in the early morning, far into\n",
      "the hills, and away from human eyes, she let the light electric breezes\n",

      "lonely desolate menacing landscape with the utter beauty of the day. She\n",
      "avoided San Francisco and Rosewater, but the extraordinary effervescence\n",
      "within her demanded an outlet of a sort, and she was so radiant to her\n",
      "small staff that they looked upon her with awe. She had actually a\n",
      "fortnight of bliss, and hoped that nothing might happen to disturb it\n",
      "for ever and ever. But no one's world has ever yet stood still.\n",
      "One day Tom Colton's hoarse voice over the telephone begged her to \"come\n",
      "at once.\" She was on her horse in ten minutes, in Rosewater in half an\n",
      "hour. There were groups of people in the street near the younger\n",
      "Coltons' house, the front door was open, several members of the family\n",
      "were passing in and out. As she entered the garden she saw one of them\n",
      "tie a knot of white ribbon to the bell knob.\n",
      "Her first impulse was to run. She felt that rather would she hear of\n",
      "Gwynne's death than face Anabel in her maternal agony. But she set her\n",
      "teeth and went on, far more frightened than sympathetic. The people that\n",
      "overflowed the hall and parlor were all crying, but nodded to her, and\n",
      "Tom Colton, haggard and white, appeared at the head of the stair and\n",
      "beckoned. He pointed to the door of his wife's bedroom, as she ascended,\n",
      "and she went forward hastily and entered without knocking. Anabel was\n",
      "standing on the threshold of the door that led into the nursery. Her\n",
      "face was white and wild, but she had not been crying.\n",
      "\"Isabel!\" she exclaimed, in loud astonished voice, \"my baby is dead! My\n",
      "baby is dead!\"\n",
      "Then Isabel, greatly to her own surprise, dropped into a chair and burst\n",
      "into vehement tears. For the moment the child was hers, she suffered\n",
      "pangs of maternal bereavement that seemed to tear her breast and twist\n",
      "her heart. But there was a terrible silence in those two rooms, and in a\n",
      "few moments it chilled and calmed her. She looked up to see Anabel\n",
      "staring at her with blank expanded eyes.\n",
      "\"What are you crying for? You?\" demanded the young mother. \"I never saw\n",
      "you cry before. And it's not your baby.\"\n",
      "\"I know it,\" said Isabel, humbly. \"I suppose it is because I am so sorry\n",
      "for you. I am--terribly.\"\n",
      "\"I never thought you had that much feeling,\" said Anabel, dully. \"You\n",
      "were always the strong one. Come and see my baby.\"\n",
      "Isabel rose, trembling and unnerved, but no longer shrinking, and\n",
      "followed Anabel into the nursery, where the child, looking like a little\n",
      "wax-work, lay in its crib.\n",
      "\"She is dead!\" said Anabel, in the same astonished indignant voice. \"My\n",
      "baby!\" She caught Isabel's arm and shook it violently. \"It isn't true,\"\n",
      "she commanded. \"Say it is not. How can it be? She spoke and laughed only\n",
      "two hours ago. The relapse was nothing. The doctor said so. That is not\n",
      "my baby.\" And then her brain stopped for a moment, and Isabel carried\n",
      "her into the other room.\n",
      "She remained with her until after the funeral. Anabel, when she\n",
      "recovered her senses, cried hopelessly for hours, but gradually\n",
      "controlled herself and rose and went about her affairs with a stern\n",
      "calm. It was her first trouble, but not for nothing had she been given a\n",
      "square jaw and a sturdy little figure. She was filled with dumb protest,\n",
      "and laid away her bright careless youth in the child's coffin, but she\n",
      "accepted the inevitable.\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Leslie were in the south when the baby died, but arrived\n",
      "for the funeral. Until then Anabel clung to her friend, and so did young\n",
      "Colton, who was far more demoralized than his wife. He did not brush his\n",
      "hair, nor go to bed, but wandered about the house like a bewildered\n",
      "spirit, occasionally smiting his hands together, or embracing the other\n",
      "two children convulsively. He had no support to offer his wife, and\n",
      "Isabel was glad to stay with the brave stricken little creature; but\n",
      "when Mrs. Leslie arrived she felt herself superfluous and returned home.\n",
      "She had had little time to think of Gwynne, but it had crossed her mind\n",
      "that she would accept this heartrending episode, in which she had been\n",
      "called upon to play an intimate part, as but another warning; one,\n",
      "moreover, that would stand its ground did she attempt to force it aside.\n",
      "But Gwynne entered and filled her dispossessed mind the moment she sat\n",
      "down under her acacia-tree, which was perhaps an hour after her return\n",
      "home. But this time her dreams did not flow upon a smooth golden scented\n",
      "tide. She searched the accumulated newspapers for mention of him in the\n",
      "despatches, wept stormily at his neglect, tormented herself with the\n",
      "belief that Julia Kaye was in Washington; at all events that he had\n",
      "discovered that his love for herself was but one more passing fancy,\n",
      "born of propinquity.\n",
      "She saw mention of him. Twice he had dined at the White House, and his\n",
      "name was frequently in the list of guests at other dinners and\n",
      "functions. He was not visiting at the British Embassy, and Isabel drew\n",
      "her only comfort from the fact: he might be enjoying himself too much to\n",
      "think of her, but his purpose was unaltered, or he certainly would be\n",
      "the guest of a man whom she knew to be his friend: Gwynne was the last\n",
      "man to embarrass anybody, and if the ambassador had enemies they would\n",
      "find his connivance at the Americanization of a useful British peer\n",
      "vastly to his own discredit.\n",
      "Isabel enjoyed no further peace of mind. The flames of uncertainty\n",
      "devoured her. The worst she could endure, but suspense spurred her\n",
      "always ardent imagination to such appalling feats that she barely ate or\n",
      "slept. But she was far too high-handed to suffer actively for long. She\n",
      "buried her pride in one of her many crypts, summoned her feminine craft,\n",
      "and wrote Gwynne a letter. It began in the brief and business-like\n",
      "manner the iniquities of their builders demanded--they were on\n",
      "strike--and her facile pen flowed on with various other items of\n",
      "information, more or less unpleasant. Mr. Clink, the lessee of Mountain\n",
      "House, had absconded with all the furniture, including the doors and\n",
      "windows, and she hesitated to refurnish, not knowing if Gwynne would\n",
      "return in time for the salmon-fishing. Nor had she been able to find\n",
      "another tenant, although she had spent two days in the mountains. She\n",
      "thought it might be a good place for a sanitarium, if he were inclined\n",
      "to form a company. Some sulphur springs had recently bubbled out of the\n",
      "ground near the house, which would add to the value of the property; but\n",
      "she must confess that they ruined the place for her. She distrusted the\n",
      "sudden advent of mineral waters; one never knew what was coming next.\n",
      "Then, after more cheering, but equally practical information, she\n",
      "rambled off into gossip, told the sad story of the Coltons' bereavement,\n",
      "and asked him a few friendly questions about himself. Of course he had\n",
      "not succeeded in getting his passport or he would be home--unless, to be\n",
      "sure, the Britisher was too strong in him after all, and he would not\n",
      "return. This alternative she contemplated with a lively regret, for she\n",
      "had had no one to talk to since he left, and so much business sat\n",
      "heavily on her shoulders. Then she announced herself his affectionate\n",
      "cousin; and it was not until the letter was gone, and quite a day of\n",
      "self-gratulation at her own adroitness, that it suddenly occurred to her\n",
      "that Gwynne had made up his mind that the first letter should come from\n",
      "her. For a few moments she was furious, then concluded that she did not\n",
      "care; she wanted to hear from him on any terms. She counted the days,\n",
      "intending finally to count the hours and minutes; but this agreeably\n",
      "breathless task came to an abrupt end at the close of the sixth day.\n",
      "Gwynne answered by telegraph. He thanked her for her interesting and\n",
      "more than welcome letter. He was well, and bored, and hoping daily to\n",
      "settle his affairs and start for home. In any case he should have\n",
      "returned to California: he was surprised at her doubts. She was not to\n",
      "bother further about his affairs out there. He had telegraphed to the\n",
      "contractor that he could wait as long as the strikers. He added that he\n",
      "longed for California.\n",
      "Isabel wondered if he had not dared to trust himself in a letter,\n",
      "finally concluded that this was the secret of the long telegram,\n",
      "dismissed her apprehensions, and, with a soothed but by no means\n",
      "tranquil imagination, yielded herself up again to dreams and the\n",
      "spring.\n",
      "VIII\n",
      "It was close upon the middle of April when Gwynne left the train a mile\n",
      "from Lumalitas, and, being unheralded, walked across the fields to his\n",
      "house. He had intended to get off at Rosewater, hire the fastest horse\n",
      "in town, and ride out to Old Inn; but he had been seized with doubt and\n",
      "diffidence, and while he was still turning hot and cold the train moved\n",
      "out of the station. It was now nearly ten weeks since he had seen\n",
      "Isabel, and during that time he had received one letter from her. This\n",
      "letter he had read and reread until its contents were meaningless; and\n",
      "he was still in doubt as to what might lurk between the lines. He was\n",
      "reasonably sure that he had forced her to write, but whether mere pique\n",
      "and curiosity had been his aides, he was far from being able to\n",
      "determine. She had been right in assuming that he dared not trust\n",
      "himself to the tempting privacy of the letter. He had no idea how he\n",
      "stood, and would not run the risk of making a fool of himself; not until\n",
      "he was face to face with her could he pretend to decide upon any course\n",
      "of action. But he had been tormented for ten weeks as he had never\n",
      "expected to be tormented by any woman. Although he still assured himself\n",
      "that he intended to marry her, the riot in his mind and blood bred\n",
      "distrust of himself and evoked terrible images of Isabel at the altar\n",
      "with another. He should hate to the day of his death the beautiful old\n",
      "town of Santa Barbara, where he had been without any sort of refuge\n",
      "from his thoughts; and in Washington, although he had managed to occupy\n",
      "his mind and time profitably, there were still hours which he must spend\n",
      "alone, and he had dreaded them.\n",
      "And he was beset by other doubts than those of the mere lover. He was\n",
      "conscious that in these weeks of absence and longing, he had idealized\n",
      "Isabel, until the being he dwelt with in fancy was more goddess than\n",
      "woman. He knew many sides of her, but much had eluded him, even after he\n",
      "began to study her. That she was gifted in large measure with what the\n",
      "Americans so aptly termed cussedness he had good reason to know; and\n",
      "whether this very definite characteristic so far controlled her nature\n",
      "as to hold her nobler qualities in durance----or were there nobler\n",
      "qualities? She had brain and common-sense; both attributes had compelled\n",
      "his respect long since. And she had character and pride--loyalty and\n",
      "independence. He had had glimpses of what he would unhesitatingly have\n",
      "accepted as heart and passion had he not known himself to be dazzled by\n",
      "her beauty and wilful powers of fascination. That she was wholly\n",
      "feminine, at least, he was convinced; she was too often absurdly so to\n",
      "keep up, with any one that saw her constantly, the fiction of the\n",
      "sexless philosopher. The very devil in her was of the unmistakable\n",
      "feminine kidney. All this gave him hope, and he knew, that when caprice\n",
      "permitted, she would be unrivalled as a companion. Intellectually, at\n",
      "least, there was no thought of his she could not share and appreciate;\n",
      "and her sense of humor and her feminine perversities would always\n",
      "delight him. If only there were depths beneath. The longings of the\n",
      "spirit are always formless, vaguely worded, a little shamefaced. Gwynne\n",
      "hardly knew what was the great extreme he wanted in his wife, but he\n",
      "knew that if he did not find it he should be miserable. He was by no\n",
      "means the young man that had fallen blindly in love with Julia Kaye. He\n",
      "had had little time for introspection, for intimate knowledge of\n",
      "himself, in those days.\n",
      "The spring was invented to remind men what mere mortals they are. Gwynne\n",
      "would have felt restless and disinclined for law and politics this\n",
      "morning had he never seen Isabel Otis. Every lark in the great valley\n",
      "was singing madly. Blue birds, yellow birds, sat on the fences and\n",
      "carolled at each other as if the world were always May. The very earth\n",
      "seemed to have sprouted into color. He had never imagined wild flowers\n",
      "by the billion, nor such a harmonious variety of color. The fields were\n",
      "green, the cherries, black and red and white, glistening and luscious,\n",
      "were ready for picking in his orchards. As he approached his house, he\n",
      "saw that all the white oaks, bare in winter, were in leaf; large soft\n",
      "young green leaves, that almost hid the pendent sad green moss. The air\n",
      "was warm and light, the sky so blue it seemed to laugh with a promise of\n",
      "eternal good things. The whole land breathed hope, and youth, and\n",
      "allurement to every delight, of which she alone possessed the store. He\n",
      "was soon to learn what a liar she was, but although it was many a long\n",
      "day before he took note of any phase of nature again, save her weather,\n",
      "he had an elusive presentiment that he should never cease to be grateful\n",
      "for that moment of quick unreasoning exultation in his youth and\n",
      "manhood, and in the mere joy of life.\n",
      "He was not surprised, as he turned the corner of the veranda, to find\n",
      "Imura Kisaburo Hinamoto sitting with his feet on the railing, a\n",
      "cigarette in his mouth, and a volume, issued by the United States Coast\n",
      "and Geodetic Survey, on his knee. But as the servant saw the master he\n",
      "rose promptly to his feet, extinguished the cigarette with his fingers,\n",
      "and stood in an attitude of extreme respect. He even smiled, but not\n",
      "propitiatingly; it was almost patent that the return of his chance\n",
      "superior was welcome.\n",
      "Gwynne nodded. \"Glad to see that you still improve your mind,\" he\n",
      "observed. \"Tell Carlos to hitch up and go for my luggage: I left it at\n",
      "the station.\" He looked at his watch. It was half-past eleven. He\n",
      "hesitated a moment, then decided to postpone his visit to Isabel again.\n",
      "He did not feel in the mood to sit down and eat with her. \"My horse at\n",
      "two o'clock,\" he added. And the Jap disappeared.\n",
      "Gwynne went into the kitchen, and Mariana, who was peeling onions for an\n",
      "_olla podrida_, screamed and embraced him.\n",
      "\"No could help,\" she said, philosophically. \"Very glad, senor, very\n",
      "glad.\"\n",
      "Gwynne was not in the humor to repulse anybody, and assured her that she\n",
      "really made him feel that he had returned to his home. Several of her\n",
      "tribe were in the kitchen and looked expectant. He informed them that he\n",
      "had a box of New York sweets in his trunk, and retreated.\n",
      "On the veranda he sat down facing his mountain, which like the rest of\n",
      "the world was a mass of delicate color, where it was not merely green,\n",
      "and seemed to move gently under the pink shimmering haze. Beyond was the\n",
      "blue crouching mass of the old volcano. \"The eternal hills\" was a phrase\n",
      "that never occurred to him when he watched these mountains, always\n",
      "veiled under a colored and moving haze. They looked far more likely to\n",
      "pull up their feet and walk off. But Gwynne, although the border\n",
      "beneath his veranda was full of sweet scents, and the roses on the\n",
      "pillars hung about him, and the air was a soft caressing tide, was no\n",
      "longer concerned with nature. He was nervous and full of doubt, of\n",
      "uneasy anticipation that he would not appear to advantage at three\n",
      "o'clock that afternoon. He knew that if he were really panic-stricken\n",
      "and attempted to carry it off in the masterful manner, she would laugh\n",
      "in his face. If he could work himself up to the attitude, well and good.\n",
      "At the same time he was vaguely conscious that this period of alternate\n",
      "hope and fear, of cold fits and hot, would one day be sweet in the\n",
      "retrospect, and regretted with some sadness; an episode in the lover's\n",
      "progress gone beyond recall.\n",
      "There was a sound of wheels on the county road, then on his own\n",
      "property. He wondered at the unusual dispatch of his Carlos, but\n",
      "realized in a moment that a buggy was approaching, not a wagon. Then\n",
      "there was a light slouching step on the veranda, and he rose to greet\n",
      "Tom Colton.\n",
      "\"By Jove, old chap, I'm glad to see you,\" he began, and thankful that he\n",
      "had written his condolences; but he paused abruptly. Colton ignored the\n",
      "outstretched hand.\n",
      "\"So you've got your passport?\" he said. And his ingenuous blue eyes were\n",
      "full of a hard antagonism.\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Gwynne. \"I should have told you in a day or two. How did you\n",
      "find out?\" he added, curiously. \"I took my oath before the passport\n",
      "clerk in the innermost recess of the State Department.\"\n",
      "\"There's not much I don't find out. Only, I got wind of this a little\n",
      "too late. So did some others, or you might have hung round Washington\n",
      "for the next four years. Do you call it square not to have told me of\n",
      "this before you left?\"\n",
      "\"I saw no obligation to take you into my confidence. In the first place\n",
      "the result of my pilgrimage was very doubtful, and in the second you\n",
      "would have done all you could to balk me. When have I given you reason\n",
      "to write me down an ass?\"\n",
      "\"You are too damned clever,\" muttered Colton. \"Too clever by half. Much\n",
      "better for you if you had stayed where you were. You had no enemies when\n",
      "you left, but now, let me tell you, you've got a bunch that it will take\n",
      "more than your cleverness to handle.\"\n",
      "\"They can do their worst. I thought that all I needed was hard work, but\n",
      "I fancy that what I missed most was the stimulus of enemies.\"\n",
      "\"Well, you've got it all right.\"\n",
      "Somewhat to the host's surprise he suddenly seated himself and tipped\n",
      "back his chair. Gwynne remained standing, leaning against a pillar, his\n",
      "hands in his pockets. Colton surveyed him frankly. His eyes were still\n",
      "hard and he was very angry, but he saw no reason why he should be\n",
      "uncomfortable, and although he could disguise his feelings when he\n",
      "chose, he knew that here it was safe to allow himself the luxury of\n",
      "frankness. He was the more annoyed, as what friendship he was capable of\n",
      "he had given to Gwynne. That would not have stayed hand or foot a\n",
      "moment, were his path in the least obstructed, but he regretted that\n",
      "they had come to an issue so early in the game. Indeed, he had hoped to\n",
      "manipulate Gwynne's destinies so subtly that they would be politically\n",
      "bound for life, with himself always a length ahead. It was true that\n",
      "once or twice he had felt a misgiving that the Englishman, with all his\n",
      "aristocratic disdain for devious ways, might match him and win, but the\n",
      "shock of this early outwitting had been none the less severe.\n",
      "\"Did you have a hard time getting it?\" he demanded.\n",
      "\"Rather. Never heard so much palaver in my life.\"\n",
      "\"Well, I wish there had been more. I think I have at least the right to\n",
      "ask what you intend to do next.\"\n",
      "\"Return to Judge Leslie's office to-morrow--for the matter of that, I\n",
      "have read a good deal since I left. In September I shall have been a\n",
      "year in the State, and of course I can vote. I am not so sure that I\n",
      "shall.\"\n",
      "\"Yes! That is all, I suppose?\"\n",
      "\"For the present. You are too good a politician to fancy that American\n",
      "citizenship has invested me with a halo. Except to a hundred odd\n",
      "farmers, Rosewater, a small group in San Francisco, and a party boss or\n",
      "two, I am unknown. No doubt I shall be several years achieving\n",
      "sufficient prominence either to run for office, or to accomplish\n",
      "anything whatever--outside of Rosewater. So far as I can see, this\n",
      "immediate citizenship has effected two results only: I am now in a\n",
      "position to take advantage of any political change that may develop,\n",
      "instead of sowing for another to reap--and--\"\n",
      "He hesitated, and Colton shot him a keen glance. \"It has made a change\n",
      "in you, I guess. I noticed that the minute I laid eyes on you. If\n",
      "anything was needed to make me madder, it was that.\"\n",
      "\"Yes--I am changed. That is to say, I am poised. In spite of the\n",
      "determination to absorb Americanism with every pore, there was always\n",
      "the lurking doubt that it wouldn't do; that some day I should make a\n",
      "bolt for England. Now the matter is settled forever. I not only am an\n",
      "American but always have been. The highest legal opinion in the country\n",
      "was called in, and that was what finally decided the question. I\n",
      "accepted it as literally as the others did, and in so doing I relegated\n",
      "my English life to the episodical backwaters: among my adventures in\n",
      "India and Africa. I fancy that if England came to a death struggle in my\n",
      "time, and every man counted, I should fight for her. I certainly never\n",
      "should fight against her. But it is a profound relief to me that I am\n",
      "not throwing her over, that we have no legitimate right to each other. I\n",
      "fancy that that, too, demoralized me a bit.\"\n",
      "\"How did you feel when you took that oath?\" asked Colton, more and more\n",
      "curious, almost forgetting his grievance. \"It's a kind of solemn oath.\n",
      "I've had a sort of chill when I've heard it taken once or twice.\"\n",
      "\"There could hardly be a more solemn oath. I don't know that it gave me\n",
      "a chill, but I certainly read it over several times before I took it.\n",
      "And I took it without any reservations.\"\n",
      "\"Did you feel an American the moment you took it?\"\n",
      "\"Yes--I did. That is to say I felt a certain buoyancy. The die was cast.\n",
      "There could be no more hesitation and doubt. My new life had actually\n",
      "begun.\"\n",
      "\"It's begun, all right. Jiminy, but you'll have a tough time. They're\n",
      "onto you now. You haven't the ghost of a chance to make a move they\n",
      "won't see before your hand is off the board.\"\n",
      "Gwynne replied with even more than his usual fluency.\n",
      "\"Yes,\" replied Colton, with a sigh. \"I guess that's where we'll all\n",
      "bring up. But meanwhile? Are you going to throw me over?\"\n",
      "\"It will depend upon yourself. I have no objection to confide to you\n",
      "such plans as I have been able to formulate. Judge Leslie advised me to\n",
      "play about in society, in Washington, but I was in no humor for anything\n",
      "of the sort. I had uncommon opportunities to study men and conditions,\n",
      "and I took full advantage of them. I doubt if I shall vote until the\n",
      "next Presidential election. Then, if an independent party of consequence\n",
      "has not been formed, and I see no prospect of working up one in this\n",
      "State, I shall vote the Democratic ticket. As things stand at present,\n",
      "it is the less of two evils, and would at least accomplish a reduction\n",
      "of the tariff, and something towards a redistribution of wealth. I\n",
      "haven't the least doubt that the Democrats, if they get in--unless they\n",
      "have a really good man up their sleeve--will abuse their power quite as\n",
      "much as the Republicans have done; but that will take some time; and\n",
      "meanwhile a new party is sure to grow up, for the best men in the\n",
      "country are thoroughly roused. There's no doubt on that point--and it is\n",
      "a point you would do well to remember. There have been chapters before\n",
      "in the world's history when right has paid.\"\n",
      "\"For a while,\" said Colton, dubiously. \"The point is now that you are\n",
      "likely to join the Democrats.\"\n",
      "\"To vote with them. Theirs are the soundest principles. I stick to that\n",
      "point.\"\n",
      "\"I don't question it. I only wish elections weren't two years off; I'd\n",
      "like to get to work.\" He took a bag of peanuts from his pocket and began\n",
      "to munch thoughtfully. \"But you are turning me off. What do you mean\n",
      "exactly?\"\n",
      "\"I shall have nothing to do with the machine. I shall speak and make\n",
      "propaganda, that is all. My object is not so much to get the Democrats\n",
      "in as the Republicans out. I shall do nothing to split the Democratic\n",
      "party--and play a losing game--unless a really great movement should\n",
      "rise, gather strength, and sweep the country. It is on the cards that\n",
      "there will be such a movement, and I throw myself into it the moment I\n",
      "am persuaded the split will not work to the advantage of the\n",
      "Republicans.\"\n",
      "\"How much enthusiasm have you pumped up?\"\n",
      "\"Enthusiasm!\" Gwynne's eyes roved over his \"fair domain.\" Isabel, at\n",
      "least, was not far from its borders! \"I cannot say that I am at\n",
      "boiling-point, but I don't fancy that matters much. I have my work cut\n",
      "out and I shall do it. Perhaps I shall work more disinterestedly without\n",
      "enthusiasm. Certainly I shall be more clear-sighted. If ever there was a\n",
      "time in the history of a country to sink individual ambition, it is\n",
      "now.\"\n",
      "\"Gwynne!\" said Colton, abruptly. \"What in thunder does it all amount to,\n",
      "anyhow? What difference does it make--will it make a thousand years\n",
      "hence--that you and I are sitting here on the very edge of creation,\n",
      "solemnly discussing the rottenest subject of our little time--American\n",
      "politics? What's the use of the socialists frothing, and nations trying\n",
      "to overturn one another? I had rather die on the spot than that the\n",
      "United States should be conquered for five minutes by Japan or any other\n",
      "Asiatic power, although I could endure the victory of a people that I\n",
      "recognized as our equals. Why are instincts planted so strongly? There\n",
      "may be a reason for a few years; but that's just it, a few mean little\n",
      "years and it is all over. What difference does anything really make, so\n",
      "long as we are comfortable? Everything else, every other instinct, is\n",
      "artificial. My wife is a religious little body and believes in reward\n",
      "and punishment hereafter, that we must spend at least a certain part of\n",
      "our time in this life preparing for the next. I'd like to believe the\n",
      "same, not only to please her, but because I could look forward to\n",
      "meeting my child again; but, somehow, I can't. The present has always\n",
      "been about as much as I could tackle. And I fancy that when I'm through\n",
      "with it, I won't want any more. But although the present whirls so fast\n",
      "that I don't have time for the sort of thinking intellectual people like\n",
      "you and Isabel do, still it does sometimes dash across my mind--that\n",
      "question: 'What is it all for? And why do we sweat through life for what\n",
      "amounts to exactly nothing in the end?'\"\n",
      "\"You cannot be sure it amounts to nothing. Sometimes I have the fancy\n",
      "that the entire round globe has just one inhabitant, of which we merely\n",
      "appear to be individual manifestations: that we are, in fact, a part of\n",
      "the earth herself, and she absorbs and casts us forth again, as she\n",
      "rushes along to her own destiny as sentient as ourselves. All the\n",
      "planets are alive in the same way, and they are all racing to see which\n",
      "will make the greatest showing on what we call down here the Judgment\n",
      "Day--that is to say, which shall have produced the most balanced and\n",
      "perfected being; which shall have whirled away the most original sin and\n",
      "sifted out a man, great and good without self-righteousness--to my mind\n",
      "the worst of mortal failings because its correlative, injustice, is the\n",
      "source of most of the unhappiness. That will be the millennium, and\n",
      "having no windmills and evils left to fight, we minute visibilities will\n",
      "welcome deindividualization. Then, no doubt, there will be a grand final\n",
      "battle between the great body of good thus formed, and the evil cast\n",
      "out, but roaming space and joining forces. If we do our best here we\n",
      "shall win, and be happy ever after. There is no question, that if you\n",
      "follow your higher instincts you are happier in the long run than if you\n",
      "fall a slave to your base and mean; and that, to my mind, is the proof\n",
      "that the highest instincts are meant to be followed to some greater\n",
      "end.\"\n",
      "\"Hm. I have heard a good many theories, first and last, and that sounds\n",
      "as plausible as any.\"\n",
      "\"All this is very casually related to American politics, except that we\n",
      "had better clean up when the opportunity is vouchsafed us; for nothing\n",
      "degrades human nature nor retards civilization so much as politics gone\n",
      "altogether wrong. As far as you are concerned, although it was\n",
      "understood that the compact was to end with my citizenship, I have no\n",
      "thought of ending it unless the conditions I hope for shall crystallize\n",
      "meanwhile. If it seems best to keep the Democratic party unsplit I shall\n",
      "do your canvassing and speaking, for it will make me known, and give me\n",
      "the opportunity to inculcate the principles I purpose to advocate. If\n",
      "you ignore them when you are in office, so much the worse for you, and\n",
      "better for me; for, as I have told you more than once, the moment I am\n",
      "in power I shall devote my energies to pulling you and your like down\n",
      "and out. But I should advise you to join the third party if it arises.\"\n",
      "\"No doubt I might, if it were strong enough,\" said Colton, frankly. \"I\n",
      "don't propose to play any losing game, and if the Democratic party goes\n",
      "by the board, T. R. Colton doesn't follow. And if a third party came in\n",
      "to stay it would have to have a boss--\"\n",
      "\"Not your sort.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, well, time enough.\" Colton's ill-humor was now somnolent under some\n",
      "two pounds of peanuts. He rose and shook hands with Gwynne. \"Glad to see\n",
      "you looking so well--you're some heavier than when you came to\n",
      "California, by-the-way, and it suits you first rate. Be sure you call on\n",
      "my wife the first time you come to town.\"\n",
      "He declined Gwynne's invitation to dinner, and drove off, looking\n",
      "slothful and amiable once more. But what went on behind that mask,\n",
      "within that long ill-built cranium, Gwynne had never pretended to guess.\n",
      "Nor, to-day, did he care.\n",
      "*       *       *       *       *\n",
      "At three o'clock he gave his horse to Abe, was told that the lady of the\n",
      "manor was out walking, and went into the house. He had a fancy to meet\n",
      "her again in the room that harbored the sweetest of his California\n",
      "memories. It was dark and cool. Only one window, looking upon the\n",
      "garden, was open. Beside it was a comfortable chair which he took\n",
      "possession of and looked out into the wild old garden so different from\n",
      "the excessively cultivated plots of Rosewater and his own meagre strips.\n",
      "There was no veranda on this side of the house, and the great\n",
      "acacia-tree, with its weight of fragrant gold, was but a few feet from\n",
      "the window. The entire garden was enclosed by a hedge of the Castilian\n",
      "roses of which he had heard so much, rare as they now were in\n",
      "California. The dull green leaves and tight little buds could hardly be\n",
      "seen for the mass of wide fluted roses of a deep old-fashioned pink. And\n",
      "there were large irregular borders covered with the luxuriant green and\n",
      "the blue stars of the periwinkle, beds of marguerites and violets,\n",
      "bushes of lilac and honeysuckles, roses and jasmine. The blended\n",
      "perfumes were overpowering, however delicious; Gwynne had sat up half\n",
      "the night before talking to his mother after a long hot journey; he fell\n",
      "asleep.\n",
      "Perhaps it was his late conversation, perhaps something more subtle, but\n",
      "he felt himself transported to a void. In a moment he realized that the\n",
      "void was not space as he knew it, but rigid invisible substance. He\n",
      "slipped along through rocky strata, hearing strange echoes and inhaling\n",
      "the disagreeable odors of healing waters. Suddenly he found himself in a\n",
      "vast hollowed space, empty but for many pillars. His vision grew keener.\n",
      "In the very centre of the hall he saw two pillars of a colossal size,\n",
      "and standing between them a being almost as large. This unthinkable\n",
      "giant had an arm about each pillar and strained as Samson had strained\n",
      "at the pillars of the temple. Then a new and powerful force drew him\n",
      "upward once more, and he awoke.\n",
      "He turned his head towards the dim interior of the room and for a dazed\n",
      "moment thought that he beheld Spring herself. She wore white and had\n",
      "dropped a mass of wild flowers at her feet; she looked as if rising out\n",
      "of them. Her hat was covered with poppies and wild azalea, and she had a\n",
      "sheaf of buttercups and \"blue eyes\" in her belt.\n",
      "\"I haven't changed my ideas one bit,\" she said, with a shrug, as Gwynne\n",
      "rose and came towards her. \"But I can't help it!\"\n",
      "IX\n",
      "Isabel rose as usual at five, but, instead of dressing at once, stood at\n",
      "her window idly and looked out over the marsh. Thirteen hours before she\n",
      "had made a decision on the instant, or so it seemed to her, and in that\n",
      "instant changed her life so completely that she was still a little\n",
      "dizzy, and the future as yet had taken on no coherent form. She had even\n",
      "told Gwynne she was positive she could _stand_ him for ever, and this,\n",
      "with her varied if incomplete knowledge of his sex, she took to be even\n",
      "more significant and hopeful than the uncompromising sense of loving\n",
      "him. No doubt there would be many interesting battles before two such\n",
      "developed personalities became more or less one, but at least he had\n",
      "none of the petty and selfish and altogether detestable qualities of her\n",
      "father, her uncle, and Lyster Stone; and he was entirely human. And he\n",
      "was young and she was young. It all seemed very wonderful; wonderful to\n",
      "be so happy, and yet to feel that she had relinquished nothing, or at\n",
      "least not the tenth of what she would have lost if she had married\n",
      "Prestage--or any other man. If she had not met Gwynne she knew that she\n",
      "never should have married at all, and, not having had the best within\n",
      "her ken, been happy enough.\n",
      "And yet she was a little sad, and it was by no means the gentle\n",
      "melancholy of reaction. She had reason, and felt a disposition to box\n",
      "her own ears. She knew that Gwynne, triumphant and happy as he was, had\n",
      "ridden away vaguely dissatisfied. He had turned and given her a keen\n",
      "questioning glance as he mounted, and had not turned again. She had\n",
      "laughed, and waved her hand, and felt a new desire to tantalize him.\n",
      "She had abandoned herself to sheer happiness the day before, to the mere\n",
      "pagan delight in an ardent lover come in her own ardent youth, to the\n",
      "sense of an unbroken circle of companionship, and to so wild a triumph\n",
      "in having brought Gwynne to her feet, made him quite mad about her, that\n",
      "she had fairly danced about the room, and tormented him as far as she\n",
      "dared.\n",
      "This was Wednesday. They were to be married on Saturday, that Lady\n",
      "Victoria, who was leaving for England in the evening, might nod them a\n",
      "blessing. Then, no doubt, Gwynne would have his way in most things, and\n",
      "she already felt the stirrings of mere female ductility. But meanwhile\n",
      "she should exercise and enjoy her own power to the full. And she had\n",
      "good reason to believe that no woman had ever been more charming,\n",
      "distracting, provocative. If Gwynne had been in love when he came, he\n",
      "had kissed her very feet when he left, and had been as bewitched as\n",
      "anyone so clear-brained could be. Moreover, she had promised him\n",
      "everything he wished, agreed without demur to the hasty marriage, and\n",
      "even, when he asked her whether she would prefer to live in her house or\n",
      "his, had sweetly left it to him to decide. They were to spend the\n",
      "honeymoon in the house on Russian Hill. She was incapable of looking\n",
      "beyond that. There had been at least twenty bewildering hints that when\n",
      "his time came one rein, at least, should be his--in all matters of great\n",
      "moment, two--and although no doubt she would break away very often,\n",
      "what more delightful than to recapture and subdue? What more could a man\n",
      "want than the most fascinating woman in the world, whom only his own\n",
      "passion could shock from mere existence into the fulness of life? But\n",
      "Gwynne, in the depths of his swimming brain, had wanted something more,\n",
      "and Isabel knew that if he had slept as ill as herself, the doubt had\n",
      "more than once assailed him if she were anything more than a charming\n",
      "beautiful and clever creature, save perverse and egotistical; who would\n",
      "keep him distractedly in love with her, but leave the best part of him\n",
      "unsatisfied.\n",
      "Her perversity had gone with him, and during a more or less wakeful\n",
      "night she had repented, and even wept at the thought that something\n",
      "might occur to exterminate him before ten o'clock on the following\n",
      "morning--when they were to meet again--and he would depart unconsoled by\n",
      "the knowledge that it was the greater needs in his own nature that had\n",
      "called to hers. At least she hoped this was so, and, in an excess of\n",
      "humility, wondered if she really had enough to give--the power to insure\n",
      "their complete happiness. She had lived in a sort of fool's paradise,\n",
      "and no doubt imagined herself a far more rounded being than she was.\n",
      "Well, she could grow, and finally she had curled down into her pillow\n",
      "and fallen asleep.\n",
      "This morning she was rather tired, and although still repentant,\n",
      "suspicious that when he returned her femininity would fly up with her\n",
      "spirits, and she would be more than content to fascinate and bewilder\n",
      "him. Like all women in love and fumbling blindly through the outer\n",
      "mysteries, she was eagerly psychological, discovering once for all her\n",
      "sex and herself.\n",
      "Her eyes had been fixed dreamily upon Tamalpais, but suddenly they were\n",
      "drawn irresistibly upward by the pricking consciousness of something\n",
      "strange. It was a moment before she realized that she had never seen a\n",
      "sky just like that before. Her back was to the east, and although the\n",
      "sun was rising it was still low; at this stage of the dawn the sky was\n",
      "generally gray. This morning it was a ghastly electric blue. And then,\n",
      "while her eyes were still staring, and something in her brain moving\n",
      "towards expression, she heard a noise that sounded like the roar of\n",
      "artillery charging across the world. She fancied it rushing through the\n",
      "Golden Gate and up the bays and marsh, before it hurled itself with a\n",
      "vicious and personal violence against the wall beneath her window. She\n",
      "braced herself against the sash as the house shook in the strongest\n",
      "earthquake she had ever felt. It appeared to be brief, however, and she\n",
      "was turning away to dress herself, when it commenced again with a fury\n",
      "and violence of which she had never dreamed the modern earth to be\n",
      "capable. She threw herself on her knees the better to grip the\n",
      "window-ledge, but her only sensations were surprise and an intense\n",
      "expectation. Electric flames, as blue and ghastly as the reeling sky,\n",
      "were playing all over the marsh, she saw the long bare line of Tamalpais\n",
      "charge down and up like a colossal seesaw; and in that terrific plunging\n",
      "and dancing, that abrupt leaping from one point of the compass to the\n",
      "opposite, or towards all at once, that hysterical shaking and struggling\n",
      "as if two planets had rushed from their orbits and were fighting for\n",
      "life in midspace, Isabel expected the entire globe to stand on end, and\n",
      "was convinced that the finish of California, at least, had come. She had\n",
      "read of earthquakes that lasted for hours, and even days, and no doubt\n",
      "this one was merely getting up steam, for it increased in violence and\n",
      "momentum every second. The house rattled like a big dice-box. She\n",
      "expected it to leap down the slope into the shivering marsh. Pieces of\n",
      "rock fell down the face of the cliff opposite, but so great was the roar\n",
      "of the earthquake, so close the sound of creaking and straining timbers,\n",
      "of falling chimneys, and china, and even plaster, that she could not\n",
      "hear the impact as they struck the ground and bounded high in air.\n",
      "Then, there was a bulge of the earth upward, a twist that seemed to\n",
      "wrench the house from its foundations, and the earthquake ceased as\n",
      "suddenly as it had come. Isabel waited a few moments for it to return,\n",
      "incredulous that the mighty forces beneath could compose themselves so\n",
      "abruptly; then rose and began to dress herself.\n",
      "Human blades of a fine temper meet a sudden and terrific onslaught of\n",
      "Nature in one of two spirits: utter cowardice, or an attitude of\n",
      "impersonal curiosity. It is not a matter of heroism but of nerves. The\n",
      "bravest may become abject, if their will has been weakened by some drain\n",
      "on the nervous system; others, that would run from a mouse or prove\n",
      "unequal to the long-heralded danger, rise, in the intense concentrated\n",
      "excitement and surprise of the moment, to a state of absolute and even\n",
      "cynical indifference. One of the unwritten laws that has descended from\n",
      "father to son in California is that an earthquake, no matter how severe,\n",
      "is a mere joke, and should incite prompt and facetious comment. Isabel\n",
      "being both heroic and hardy, paid the California tradition the tribute\n",
      "of a smile and a shrug, and regretted that she had not been in San\n",
      "Francisco; she \"liked being in the midst of things.\" Sentiment,\n",
      "psychology, egoism, had literally been bounced out of her. She knew that\n",
      "Gwynne might easily have been killed, but although she intended to find\n",
      "out in the least possible time, to feel merely human in the face of such\n",
      "a stupendous exhibition of what nature could do when she chose, was a\n",
      "descent of which she, at least, felt herself incapable.\n",
      "She hurried on her riding-clothes, dropped her braid under her jacket,\n",
      "and ran down the stairs. Chuma, trim and spotless, was sweeping the\n",
      "hall, white with fallen plaster. He gave her his usual good-morning grin\n",
      "and went on with his work. She paused and regarded him curiously.\n",
      "\"What do you think of our earthquakes?\" she demanded.\n",
      "\"Oh, very big shake,\" he said, cheerfully. \"Very big shake.\"\n",
      "Vaguely nettled she took her hat from the rack and went out by the back\n",
      "way. Mac had knocked on her door immediately after the earthquake, and\n",
      "was now with Abe in the colony on the hills. He came running down when\n",
      "he saw her, and it was patent that his rheumatism, for once, was\n",
      "forgotten. His old red face with its prominent bones set in thick sandy\n",
      "gray hair was more animated than Isabel had ever seen it.\n",
      "\"Glory be!\" he exclaimed, as he reached her. \"That was about the worst!\n",
      "I was just tellin' Abe that I felt the great earthquake of '68 in this\n",
      "very house, in that very room, by gum, although I was up and dressed,\n",
      "for it was eight o'clock, and I'd gone back for my pipe. So, I know what\n",
      "I'm talkin' about, Miss Isabel, when I say that this was about four\n",
      "times as bad--\"\n",
      "\"Please saddle my horse.\"\n",
      "\"Yes, marm. Wisht I could have got out of bed. I'd like to have seen if\n",
      "the earth rose and fell in a long wave like the shake of '68. Land's\n",
      "sakes, but those chickens did squawk.\" And although he saddled Kaiser\n",
      "rapidly, he never paused in his reminiscence of the last Northern\n",
      "California earthquake to pass into history. \"But this one! By Jiminy!\n",
      "Well, I guess we take the cake in everything out here, earthquakes\n",
      "included.\"\n",
      "Isabel patted the still shaking horse. \"Get the launch ready,\" she said,\n",
      "as she mounted; and Mac nodded. It was characteristic that neither\n",
      "thought of the danger of sudden shoals, of the always possible tidal\n",
      "wave, or of some new and diabolical trick of nature. The nerves were\n",
      "still keyed too high for anything so shabby as prudence.\n",
      "Kaiser, no doubt glad to put himself into motion, bounded forward as his\n",
      "mistress lifted the bridle, and although Isabel did give an occasional\n",
      "glance ahead, to make sure the earth was not yawning, she never drew\n",
      "rein, and the horse galloped with all his might towards Rosewater. As\n",
      "the marsh narrowed she saw that the town was still there, and that there\n",
      "were no fires. As she approached the great iron bridge that connected\n",
      "Rosewater with the continuation of the county road, a horseman entered\n",
      "at its other end and galloped across, regardless of the law or a graver\n",
      "danger still. The next moment Isabel and Gwynne had shaken hands\n",
      "casually, and were riding towards Old Inn.\n",
      "His eyes were shining and almost black. \"I saw the mountains rock!\" he\n",
      "exclaimed. \"Rock? Dance. Then I thought they would plunge down into the\n",
      "earth and disappear. And St. Peter is flat. All the business district,\n",
      "including the four hotels, are down, and everybody in them buried in the\n",
      "ruins. A man dashed up as I was mounting, and I told all the men on the\n",
      "place to go to the rescue. The news came just in time to prevent the\n",
      "murder of Imura by Carlos, for not admitting that we had had the\n",
      "greatest earthquake in the history of the world. It was the first\n",
      "symptom of patriotic fire I ever saw in Imura, but he stoutly maintained\n",
      "that in the matter of earthquakes Japan could do as well as California.\"\n",
      "\"That is all very well, but I have read a lot about Japanese\n",
      "earthquakes, and never of such an _extraordinary_ one as this. Has\n",
      "anything terrible happened in Rosewater?\"\n",
      "\"I saw a few chimneys down, but no buildings except the old brick\n",
      "school-house. Mrs. Haight was sitting on the curb-stone in her\n",
      "night-gown, wailing like a banshee, but although all the rest of the\n",
      "town appeared to be in the streets, and similarly attired, they were\n",
      "quiet enough. As I passed the cemetery I gave it a hasty side glance,\n",
      "half-afraid of what I might see. All the monuments are down and pointing\n",
      "in every direction. What gyrations! Do you suppose they've had it in San\n",
      "Francisco?\"\n",
      "\"Do I suppose--much you know about our earthquakes! San Francisco always\n",
      "gets the worst of it, or seems to, there is so much more to shake. Your\n",
      "mother is probably in hysterics, although up on the hills one is safe\n",
      "enough. It is the sandy valley and the made ground down by the\n",
      "ferries--up to Montgomery Street, in fact--that get the worst of it. I\n",
      "have ordered the launch.\"\n",
      "\"Good. I wish my mother had gone east from El Paso, as she had half a\n",
      "mind to do. But she wanted to see her doctor again. I am afraid she\n",
      "won't look at this as we do. I never was so interested in my life. Was\n",
      "sure we were going to smash, but that it was worth while in anything so\n",
      "stupendous. I suppose it is too early to telephone.\"\n",
      "Isabel pointed to the wires. They were sagging, and two of the telegraph\n",
      "poles were down. \"Doubtless the tracks are twisted, too. We are\n",
      "fortunate to have the launch.\"\n",
      "X\n",
      "Mac, so swollen with the prideful experience which enabled him to\n",
      "compare two great earthquakes, and his accumulations of practical data\n",
      "bearing thereon, appeared ten years younger, and, as Gwynne and Isabel\n",
      "rode up, was lording it over his fellow-hirelings. He had forbidden\n",
      "Chuma to make a fire in the kitchen stove until the chimney, what was\n",
      "left of it, had been repaired, directed him to bring down-stairs the\n",
      "oil-stove Isabel had bought for the old rheumatic's comfort, and cook\n",
      "breakfast upon it. As even the stovepipe in the out-building, used for\n",
      "preparing the elaborate repasts of the Leghorn, was twisted, Abe had\n",
      "been ordered to drag the great stove into the open, build a screen about\n",
      "it, and \"do the best he could, and be thankful he was alive.\" Poor Abe,\n",
      "who had not been extant in 1868, and had even missed the considerable\n",
      "earthquakes of the Nineties, was in a somewhat demoralized state, and\n",
      "wondering audibly what people supposed he cared about chickens, anyhow.\n",
      "Isabel and Gwynne sat down in the dining-room and ate their\n",
      "breakfast--on fragments--calmly and methodically, talking constantly of\n",
      "the earthquake, it is true, but instinct with that curious casuistry\n",
      "that a certain safety lay in following the ordinary routine of life;\n",
      "perhaps--who knows?--so great is the egoism of the human spirit--that\n",
      "the unswerving march of man in his groove might restore the balance of\n",
      "nature.\n",
      "After breakfast Isabel went up to her room and dressed hastily and\n",
      "mechanically in a short walking-suit, as mechanically expecting the same\n",
      "earthquake to return to the spot associated with it. Gwynne wore his\n",
      "khaki riding-clothes, but it was doubtful if any one would be critical\n",
      "in San Francisco that morning. Nothing, as it happened, could have\n",
      "suited his purpose better, and it was long before he took them off.\n",
      "When the launch was under way Isabel told Gwynne of the blue flames that\n",
      "had danced over the marsh during the convulsion. \"If electricity is not\n",
      "a cause of earthquakes, it certainly is let loose by them,\" she added.\n",
      "\"I expected every moment that we would blow up and fly off into space.\"\n",
      "\"I saw something of the same sort on the hills, and expected to see St.\n",
      "Helena spout flames.\"\n",
      "In a few moments they were sensible that the constant artificial\n",
      "vibration of the boat was the most grateful sensation they had ever\n",
      "known, and of the wish that they could leave it only for a train, to be\n",
      "transferred at the end of a long journey to another train, and still\n",
      "another. But these sentiments were not exchanged, and their conversation\n",
      "was purely extrinsic. Here and there along the shore an old shanty lay\n",
      "on its side, or had tumbled forward to its knees; but for the most part\n",
      "dilapidated chimneys and fallen poles were the only visible symbols of\n",
      "the tumult beneath the smiling beautiful earth. Never had Earth looked\n",
      "so green, so velvety, its flowers so gay and voluptuous. Even the sky,\n",
      "now its normal deep blue, had this same velvety quality, the very\n",
      "atmosphere seemed to breathe the same rich satisfaction. But no birds\n",
      "were singing, and there was nothing normal in the groups of people,\n",
      "gathered wherever there were habitations: they wore bath-robes,\n",
      "blankets, overcoats, anything, apparently, they had found at hand, and\n",
      "had not re-entered their treacherous habitations. No trains were\n",
      "running, but the drawbridge that separated the marsh from San Pablo Bay\n",
      "opened as usual.\n",
      "Gwynne steered the launch, and his conversation and Isabel's drifted to\n",
      "speculations as to what had happened in the city.\n",
      "\"Thank heaven I had the foundations of that old house replaced,\" she\n",
      "said, \"or I am afraid your mother would have shot right down to the\n",
      "Hofers' doorstep. I am fairly at ease about The Otis, for in spite of\n",
      "the old drifting sand-lots that district is built on, its foundations go\n",
      "down to bed-rock, and thanks to the strikers there is nothing to fall\n",
      "off the steel frame. But I am rather worried about the islands. San\n",
      "Francisco Bay is supposed to have been a valley some two hundred years\n",
      "ago, and if it dropped once it might again. Those islands are only\n",
      "hilltops.\"\n",
      "The islands, however, looked as serene as the rest of nature, although\n",
      "most of the chimneys were fallen or twisted, and there were the same\n",
      "groups of people in the open, awaiting another throe. These, however,\n",
      "had had time to recover their balance and clothe themselves. The launch,\n",
      "which had a new engine, had been driven at top speed, and it was not yet\n",
      "seven o'clock, barely the beginning of day to these luxurious people,\n",
      "but a day that would doubtless be remembered as the longest of their\n",
      "lives. On the military islands, routine, apparently, had received no\n",
      "dislocation, and on the steep romantic slopes of Belvedere the villas\n",
      "might have sunken their talons to the very vitals of the rock. The most\n",
      "precariously perched had paid no toll but the chimney.\n",
      "As the launch bounded past the long eastern side of Angel Island, Gwynne\n",
      "contracted his eyelids. \"Have you noticed that black cloud over the\n",
      "city?\" he asked. \"At first it did not strike me particularly--but--it\n",
      "looks as if there might be a big fire.\"\n",
      "Isabel, who faced him, turned her head. \"There are always fires in San\n",
      "Francisco after an earthquake,\" she said, indifferently. \"And about\n",
      "seven a day at any time. There are none on the hills, so your mother is\n",
      "not having a second fright. Poor thing! I am afraid she is terribly\n",
      "upset. I wish she had gone.\"\n",
      "She sat about, to observe the city more critically. Already its sky-line\n",
      "was changed, for every chimney, smokestack, and steeple, commonly\n",
      "visible, was shattered or down. The smoke cloud, which looked like a\n",
      "great ostrich plume bent at the tip, was as stationary as the hills, and\n",
      "had a confident permanent air that they would lack for some time. And\n",
      "fixed as it was it seemed to grow larger.\n",
      "\"Steer to the east of Alcatraz,\" said Isabel, suddenly; \"and towards\n",
      "Yerba Buena. I should like to see where the fires are.\"\n",
      "When the launch was well off the point of Telegraph Hill, they saw\n",
      "several large fires on the western side of East Street, the wide roadway\n",
      "that divided the city from the water-front and Ferry Building. Far down,\n",
      "in the South of Market Street district there appeared to be other large\n",
      "fires.\n",
      "\"Warehouses, probably,\" said Isabel. \"What a sight!\" She indicated the\n",
      "collapsed sheds about the moles, and the twisted and toppling\n",
      "appearance of the tower on the Ferry Building, which stood on the edge\n",
      "of the made ground. It was an immense structure of great weight, and\n",
      "only an uncommon honesty--and vigilance--in building had saved it from\n",
      "destruction. Had the piles been hollow, or too short to reach bed-rock,\n",
      "it would either have sunken or tumbled.\n",
      "And then they noticed that the bay was silent and deserted. It was a\n",
      "moment before they realized that of the several lines of ferry-boats\n",
      "none appeared to be running. \"That means that the tracks are out of\n",
      "working order,\" said Isabel, grimly. \"We may have had the best of it,\n",
      "bad as it was. Ah!\" One of the Oakland ferry-boats pushed out of its San\n",
      "Francisco mole. It was black with people. Isabel stared with wonder. \"It\n",
      "looks as if people were running away from the city. Or perhaps a good\n",
      "many that live across the bay came over on the same mission as\n",
      "ourselves, and have been turned back. That would mean that all East\n",
      "Street was on fire and they could not get into the city. Well, let us\n",
      "hurry. Even although the fires are so far off they may terrify your\n",
      "mother. I remember she told me once in England that she had never seen a\n",
      "fire. I have a queer sensation in my knees.\"\n",
      "Gwynne laughed. \"I should think you might be used to fires by this time.\n",
      "And you have a celebrated fire department. I fancy you are just feeling\n",
      "the reaction.\"\n",
      "\"I was not a bit frightened during the earthquake!\" said\n",
      "Isabel, indignantly. \"But there is nothing _phenomenal_ in fire to brace\n",
      "one up--and those had a sinister determined look--and that boat-load of\n",
      "people! I only hope your mother has not run away--under the impression\n",
      "that San Francisco alone was shaken. We wouldn't find her for a week.\"\n",
      "\"My mother's nerves are not what they were, but I am positive she will\n",
      "not run. She is certain to wait for us at the house.\"\n",
      "A few moments later they ran the launch up to the landing at the foot of\n",
      "Russian Hill. There were a few tumbled shanties on the slope, but none\n",
      "of the well-built houses had been dislodged, and the great buildings on\n",
      "this water-front were in good condition. Mr. Clatt was not visible, but\n",
      "left his cottage at Isabel's call, and gave them something more than his\n",
      "usual surly greeting.\n",
      "\"Glad to see you are all right,\" he said. \"Been expectin' you. Jest\n",
      "stepped in to git my pipe.\"\n",
      "\"Much damage done?\" asked Gwynne.\n",
      "\"Considerable, but I guess the shake'll take a back seat. City's on\n",
      "fire.\"\n",
      "\"There are always fires after earthquakes,\" said Isabel, angrily.\n",
      "\"City's on fire. Thirty broke out s'multaneous. Water main's bust. Chief\n",
      "of Fire Department killed in his bed, or as good as killed. There's\n",
      "plenty left to fight the fire but nothin' to fight it with. Guess the\n",
      "old town'll go up in smoke this time.\"\n",
      "\"My knees feel rather weak, too,\" said Gwynne. He turned to the\n",
      "wharfinger, who was pulling leisurely at his pipe. \"We--my mother and\n",
      "Miss Otis, at least, may need this launch to leave the city with,\" he\n",
      "said. \"Can I rely on you? You shall have a hundred dollars if you let no\n",
      "one steal it; and if the fire should reach this side, you are welcome to\n",
      "a refuge on my ranch.\"\n",
      "\"I'll see daylight through any one that looks at it,\" said Mr. Clatt.\n",
      "\"This ain't no time to stand on ceremony. The army's called out already\n",
      "to help the police keep order--the lootin' was disgraceful for about an\n",
      "hour. Every rat tumbled out of his hole, and of course they went for the\n",
      "saloons. I'm well enough known along here to be let alone when I show my\n",
      "teeth. Your house is all right, miss.\"\n",
      "This side of the hill was almost deserted; nearly every one seemed to be\n",
      "watching the fires from the crest; but occasionally Gwynne and Isabel\n",
      "passed a solitary person clinging to his possessions, or a small group;\n",
      "and invariably were greeted with the same remark: \"City's on fire. Water\n",
      "mains were broken by the earthquake.\"\n",
      "As they passed through the crowd on the hill-top, they received similar\n",
      "information, although many added confidently that \"something would be\n",
      "done. The wind was sure to change to the west.\"\n",
      "And so far, at least, the picture from the heights was by no means\n",
      "appalling. There were a number of fires in the south, and a wall of\n",
      "flame and smoke along the water-front near the Ferry Building. Had the\n",
      "earthquake spared the mains they would merely have been spectacular.\n",
      "Gwynne and Isabel, as they made the slight descent to the Belmont House,\n",
      "saw two of their Japs sitting on the roof throwing down the bricks of\n",
      "the fallen chimneys. Then they turned the corner and found Lady\n",
      "Victoria, an opera-cloak thrown over her night-clothes, pacing up and\n",
      "down the veranda.\n",
      "\"Oh, my God!\" she exclaimed. \"I did not dare to wonder if you were dead\n",
      "or alive. Why did we ever come to this God-forsaken country?\" She did\n",
      "not offer to embrace them, but her eyes were brilliant, and there was a\n",
      "color in her cheeks. And no one had ever heard her talk so fast. \"Was\n",
      "it as dreadful with you? Did you get out of the house? I was awake when\n",
      "I heard that awful roar. Somehow, I knew what it meant, and before the\n",
      "earthquake was well begun I was out here. I never ran so fast in my\n",
      "life, although I was flung against the walls. And I almost wished I had\n",
      "stayed in the house. Such a sight! That awful reeling city! Just imagine\n",
      "thousands of buildings plunging, and leaping, and dancing, and toppling.\n",
      "Towers bowing to you so solemnly that I almost disgraced myself and had\n",
      "hysterics. And steeples pitching off, or huddling down like corpses. And\n",
      "that awful loud deep steady roar and crash of a thousand walls and\n",
      "chimneys falling. And the dust that seemed to swallow the city. For a\n",
      "moment I thought it had gone, and expected the hills to follow. Then it\n",
      "rose and everybody on earth seemed to be in those streets--and in white.\n",
      "They looked like Isabel's Leghorns. Such pigmies from up here. Pigmies!\n",
      "That is what we all are. And Angelique, the wretch, has run away.\"\n",
      "\"Well, she cannot go far, as all the railroads but one seem to be\n",
      "injured,\" said Gwynne, soothingly. \"Better go in and dress and we'll\n",
      "walk down and take a look at things. That will divert your mind.\"\n",
      "But it was not until Isabel had assured her that the worst force of an\n",
      "earth movement in California spent itself in the first great shock, and\n",
      "offered to help her dress, that Victoria could be persuaded to enter the\n",
      "house. Gwynne fetched Isabel's field-glass and studied the scene below,\n",
      "picking out the more disastrous work of the earthquake. All the new\n",
      "solid buildings, and most of the old, appeared to be unharmed, and the\n",
      "residence district, built of wood on stone foundations, for the most\n",
      "part, was much as usual, save for its altered sky-line: every chimney\n",
      "and skylight had disappeared. But tall slender factory chimneys had\n",
      "broken raggedly in half, and the great tower of the City Hall, standing\n",
      "high against the blue sky and advancing smoke, seemed to shriek like a\n",
      "man whose flesh had been torn off with hot pincers until only the shamed\n",
      "skeleton was left. Nothing but the steel cage that had supported the\n",
      "bricks remained: eloquent of the millions that a dishonest city\n",
      "government and its confederates had stolen.\n",
      "Gwynne, as his eyes travelled more precisely, picked out more and more\n",
      "evidences of the power of the earthquake. Steeples were gone, walls\n",
      "fallen outward, roofs caved in, or yawning where a heavy chimney had\n",
      "gone through, old houses were on their knees, or had fallen into their\n",
      "cellars. Great cracks and rifts in walls and asphalt, fallen cornices\n",
      "and shattered windows detached themselves from the general picture of\n",
      "the half-ruined but oddly indifferent city. Almost immediately, through\n",
      "the smoke in the southeast, he had caught a glimpse of The Otis, an\n",
      "immense skeleton of steel, that had defied the earth, and offered\n",
      "nothing to the fire. But although he experienced a passing gratitude\n",
      "that he should lose nothing by the disaster, he forgot the incident in a\n",
      "moment: he felt wholly impersonal.\n",
      "Everybody in the city, apparently, was out-of-doors. The squares were\n",
      "black with people, quiet crowds, it would seem, moving slowly where they\n",
      "moved at all. He saw mounted officers and parading soldiers, and groups\n",
      "of firemen standing impotently by their hose and engines. In the burning\n",
      "South of Market Street district rivers of people were pouring towards\n",
      "the great central highway, their arms and shoulders burdened; fleeing no\n",
      "doubt with their household goods. Then Gwynne began to study the fires,\n",
      "and it dawned upon him that he was looking down not upon a mere\n",
      "conflagration but a burning city. It was more than likely that the fires\n",
      "would not cross Market Street, and that those near the water-front would\n",
      "be extinguished by water pumped from the bay; but \"South of Market\n",
      "Street\" was a city in itself, and not only did he feel a certain pity\n",
      "for all those terrified black pigmies down there, but a pang for the\n",
      "extinction of a region so identified with the early history of San\n",
      "Francisco. Rincon Hill was obliterated by the smoke, but no doubt she\n",
      "would go; with all her pretty old-fashioned houses, so unlike the\n",
      "horrors on the plateau below him--and South Park with its tragic\n",
      "memories. Moreover, if all the factories and warehouses, and the blocks\n",
      "devoted to the wholesale business, were destroyed, the city would be\n",
      "poorer by many millions.\n",
      "He shifted his glass away from the fires. More and more details arrested\n",
      "his eye. Inert forms were being carried out of houses where chimneys or\n",
      "skylights had gone through the roof. Automobiles were flying about,\n",
      "hundreds of them. Mounted orderlies were dashing at breakneck speed\n",
      "between the Presidio and the city. For a moment he wondered, then\n",
      "remembered that General Funston lived on Nob Hill. He inferred that the\n",
      "Mechanics' Fair Building, down in the western section of the valley, had\n",
      "been turned into a hospital, for automobiles were constantly dashing up\n",
      "and delivering limp and helpless burdens. The old Mission Church,\n",
      "Dolores, was unharmed, but not far away, and in that crowded district\n",
      "built upon the filled-in lake, or lagoon, of the Spanish era, he saw\n",
      "that a large building, doubtless a cheap and flimsy hotel, had sunken\n",
      "to its upper story, and that people were digging frantically about it.\n",
      "Every house in the immediate neighborhood had dropped into its cellar or\n",
      "lurched off its foundations. But it was all like some horrid picture by\n",
      "Dore: the smoky darkening atmosphere, the jets, the bouquets, the square\n",
      "masses of flame, each seeming to embrace a block if not more, the dark\n",
      "slowly rolling clouds not far overhead, the tides of humanity dwarfed by\n",
      "the distance, the broken dislocated houses, the great haughty defiant\n",
      "buildings, with the superb conflagration behind them.\n",
      "One of the neighbors, who lived on the crest, returning from a\n",
      "reconnoitring expedition, paused and informed him that the mayor had\n",
      "been persuaded to call a meeting of the more prominent citizens, to\n",
      "decide, if possible, what might be done to save the city, and to keep\n",
      "the people from falling into a panic. Mr. Phelan, the \"Reform Mayor\"--of\n",
      "the city's last period of municipal decency--had suggested sending to\n",
      "the military islands for dynamite enough to blow up a wide zone beyond\n",
      "the fire; but property-owners were already protesting. Many felt sure\n",
      "the fire would not cross Market Street, others were as certain that the\n",
      "whole city would go. A corps of marines had been despatched from Mare\n",
      "Island immediately after the earthquake and would undoubtedly save the\n",
      "Ferry Building and the docks, but if the fire ran over from Market\n",
      "Street a few blocks higher up, nothing could save all that great\n",
      "business, shopping, and hotel district; to say nothing of Chinatown, and\n",
      "possibly these hills. All South of Market Street was in motion, making\n",
      "for the ferries or the bare western hills, the Presidio and Park; they\n",
      "must answer for many of the fires, as they had not given a thought to\n",
      "cracked chimneys when they wanted their breakfast; but of course crossed\n",
      "wires and the overhead trolley system were responsible for as many more.\n",
      "Then he advised Gwynne to order that all the bath-tubs in the house\n",
      "should be filled with what water was left in the pipes, and that a stock\n",
      "of provisions from the neighboring grocer and butcher should be laid in.\n",
      "\"Personally I don't believe the fire will ever come as far as this,\" he\n",
      "said. \"But there'll be a famine, no doubt of that. The wires are all\n",
      "down, scarcely a train is running, the country may be as hard hit as\n",
      "ourselves--and all that crowd down there to feed!\"\n",
      "Gwynne thanked him and replied that the launch was in waiting; but when\n",
      "the man had gone he called the Japs, gave them money, and ordered them\n",
      "to follow his neighbor's suggestion. He realized that he had no desire\n",
      "to leave this city where life was suddenly keyed to its highest pitch,\n",
      "and retire to the security and inaction of the country. Moreover, he\n",
      "recalled the promise he had given Hofer and his other friends on the\n",
      "night of the ball: this might be the emergency, and what services he\n",
      "could render should be given freely enough.\n",
      "Lady Victoria and Isabel came forth, and they all made their way rapidly\n",
      "down to Nob Hill. The stair was more rickety than ever, and many of the\n",
      "older houses they passed looked badly shaken within, if not\n",
      "without--every door was open. The floors were covered with plaster; more\n",
      "often than not the furniture and ornaments, and even mantels, were\n",
      "massed in an indistinguishable heap. The Hofers' door, like the rest,\n",
      "was open, and they saw that the spiral marble stair was a pile of\n",
      "glittering splinters and that the pictures had been turned completely\n",
      "round or flung across the hall. Mrs. Hofer had been too eager to reign\n",
      "on Nob Hill to wait for a new foundation. Several of the servants were\n",
      "sitting on the steps, and informed Gwynne that all the family, including\n",
      "the children, had gone out in two automobiles an hour before, to see the\n",
      "city.\n",
      "They walked down the hill, stopped many times by returning citizens\n",
      "anxious to impart information. The Italians on Telegraph Hill were mad\n",
      "with terror: \"they were no Californians,\" in accents of bitter contempt.\n",
      "Portsmouth Square was full of Chinamen laughing at the women that had\n",
      "run there from the hotels without shoes on their feet, and only an opera\n",
      "or automobile cloak over their night-clothes. Even more amused were\n",
      "those Oriental philosophers at the white scared faces of the prisoners\n",
      "clinging to the bars of the jail. Nobody could tell how many people had\n",
      "been killed by falling roofs and walls, although the wildest stories\n",
      "were current, but so far there were more doctors and nurses attending to\n",
      "business than patients to care for. Down in the Mechanics' Fair\n",
      "Building, which had been converted into an emergency hospital, they were\n",
      "working as methodically, with book and pencil, as well as with bandage\n",
      "and instrument, as if earthquake and fire were a part of the daily\n",
      "routine. \"Almost everybody was quiet, but there were sights down there,\n",
      "Oh, Lord, there were sights!\" One man button-holed Gwynne, as he had\n",
      "button-holed others on his ascent, and informed him that he had \"got\n",
      "down there\" just in time to see two hundred and fifty thousand dollars\n",
      "go up in smoke. \"Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, and it has\n",
      "taken me twenty years to make it!\" he reiterated, with an excited\n",
      "bitterness that was almost hilarious. He did not ask Gwynne if he had\n",
      "lost anything, but passed on to button-hole the next man and pour out\n",
      "his tale of individual protest; upon him the earthquake and fire had\n",
      "made a personal attack.\n",
      "\"How strange it seems to be in the midst of so much _life_--mere\n",
      "physical life,\" said Lady Victoria. \"A whole city tense and helpless! I\n",
      "wonder that man could think of himself. We are all mere fragments of one\n",
      "great whole.\"\n",
      "Her eyes were still restless and bright, her mask had fallen, and with\n",
      "it, curiously, many of her years. For a time, at least, the heavy burden\n",
      "of self had slipped from her tired spirit.\n",
      "Few stood in the doorways, or even gardens; nearly every one not\n",
      "exploring the city was in the middle of the street. In the\n",
      "boarding-house district, half-way down the hill, the corners were\n",
      "crowded with people watching the fires, although as many more had gone\n",
      "to the heights to command a better view. Some were still dazed and white\n",
      "with terror, a few looked distraught; more than one man was as nervous\n",
      "as his wife. But the majority were calm, although they wore an\n",
      "expression of being ready for anything. A few, mindful of the California\n",
      "tradition, were joking and relating the absurdities of their experience.\n",
      "There was no question that the shock had been far greater in the city\n",
      "than in and about Rosewater, and both Isabel and Gwynne, to Lady\n",
      "Victoria's disgust, expressed a regret that they \"had missed anything.\"\n",
      "But it was possible that the convulsion had been even worse elsewhere.\n",
      "St. Peter was built over a known fault, and San Francisco was not; and\n",
      "indeed news was already coming into the city of coast hamlets that had\n",
      "literally been torn to pieces. Other wild rumors were flying about. New\n",
      "York had disappeared. Chicago had been swept by a tidal wave. As the\n",
      "telegraph wires were all down no one attempted to account for these\n",
      "items of news, but so much had already happened that if the eastern\n",
      "hemisphere had dropped to the level of Atlantis, no one would have\n",
      "stared.\n",
      "When they reached Union Square they found it so crowded that they hardly\n",
      "could make their way. Not only the guests of the St. Francis Hotel, that\n",
      "flanked it, had taken refuge in the open, but those of many other\n",
      "hotels. A few of the men were still in pyjamas, and of the women in\n",
      "dressing-gown or opera-cloak, caught up as they fled. But the majority\n",
      "had ventured back and dressed themselves, so that the \"sights\" were not\n",
      "what they may have been an hour earlier. But no one seemed to care for\n",
      "shelter; at all events they liked companionship in misery, although few\n",
      "besides the foreign members of the Grand Opera Company were voluble.\n",
      "Gwynne and Victoria and Isabel saw many of their acquaintance, not all\n",
      "recognizable at first, for even those that had returned to their rooms\n",
      "to dress themselves had taken little pains with their hair. One woman of\n",
      "great beauty, however, whose husband's hat surmounted her flowing locks,\n",
      "was just informing Isabel that she had reached that frame of mind where\n",
      "vanity was pressing apprehension to the wall, when there was an\n",
      "explosive sound, another as of rushing wings, the crowd stumbled against\n",
      "one another, and the large buildings about the square rocked. Again\n",
      "there was an exodus, and some clutching and gasping; but only a few of\n",
      "the refugees from the burning district, sitting on the furniture they\n",
      "had dragged with them, screamed. It was over in a few seconds, and then\n",
      "Gwynne pressed his women gently out of the crowd and down, through the\n",
      "tide of refugees, to Market Street. They walked in the middle of the\n",
      "street, for the sidewalks in this business district, where many of the\n",
      "buildings were of brick or stone, were littered with the debris of\n",
      "fallen cornice and shattered windows and chimneys. Market Street was\n",
      "kept open for automobiles, and the crossing refugees; the spectators\n",
      "stood on the edge of the northern pavement only, and in some cases on\n",
      "the top of bricks that represented an outer wall. A number of the\n",
      "refugees were marching towards the ferries, although a curtain of smoke\n",
      "bounded the lower end of Market Street. Others were moving stolidly\n",
      "towards the western hills. All were burdened with pillow-cases packed\n",
      "with clothing, or dragged trunks, cribs, baby-carriages, in which was a\n",
      "strange assortment of utensils, children, and household pets. The\n",
      "scrape, scrape of these unwieldy objects could be heard in a monotonous\n",
      "reiteration above the distant roar and crackling of the flames. Behind\n",
      "the tide of humanity rolling in from the burning district, at the end of\n",
      "every street, was a vista of flame and smoke. And the dark clouds were\n",
      "mounting higher and higher, lit with a million golden sparks. The\n",
      "temperature was tropical.\n",
      "People were already beginning to talk in phrases: The doomed city. The\n",
      "fire zone. Razed to the ground. Brains were not active, and any one\n",
      "energetic enough to put a few expressive words together was sure of\n",
      "disciples. Here, more than elsewhere, it was apparent that the army was\n",
      "in possession of the city. Mounted officers rode slowly up and down, and\n",
      "at the mouth of each of those dusky and menacing avenues was a guard\n",
      "with drawn bayonets. They permitted the unfortunate to emerge, but few\n",
      "to enter. In spite of the audible energy of the fire, the slow tramp of\n",
      "the refugees, the scraping of their furniture on the ill-paved streets,\n",
      "the city was extraordinarily silent. People scarcely spoke above a\n",
      "mutter. There was no shouting of orders. Even the children were not\n",
      "whimpering, the tawdry women were not hysterical, not a parrot raised\n",
      "his voice nor a dog whined. Faces were dazed, blank, imprinted with a\n",
      "stolid determination to get to a place of safety and keep families and\n",
      "belongings together. The present moment was as much as they could grasp,\n",
      "and truth to tell there was a good deal in it.\n",
      "Some of the sightseers speculated mildly--those that owned no property\n",
      "in this district--as to what would happen if the wind drove the fire\n",
      "much farther north. The opposite side of the street was lined with some\n",
      "of the greatest business houses in the city. The Palace Hotel looked\n",
      "like the rock of Gibraltar. Not a vase in its court had been overturned,\n",
      "some one said. The other buildings were of stone, brick, concrete. They\n",
      "had stood the earthquake; even the great square tower of the Call\n",
      "Building, unsupported by other buildings, had barely lost a cornice. Was\n",
      "it possible that the fire would take them? But the fire was rolling\n",
      "nearer every moment, for it met little to resist it but wood. Down by\n",
      "East Street several of the Market Street buildings were blazing. But no\n",
      "doubt the marines would extinguish those, and surely that sea of flame\n",
      "would break and retreat before the wall of rock opposite; and behind it\n",
      "were other structures of stone and brick and concrete. Now and then a\n",
      "refugee, permitting his attention to be drawn from his own little\n",
      "affairs, told that the back windows of these buildings were already hung\n",
      "with wet blankets, and that people stood by the cisterns on the roofs,\n",
      "hose in hand. But the South of Market Street fraternity shook a united\n",
      "head, and when the new phrase, The doomed city, was wafted into its dull\n",
      "ears, it adopted it promptly, and marched on muttering it over and\n",
      "over.\n",
      "XI\n",
      "Already a number of automobiles had flown by, some filled with people\n",
      "anxious to leave town before it might be too late, but most of them\n",
      "containing surgeons and their assistants, or relays of firemen, alone\n",
      "permitted to enter the burning district; or prominent men bound for the\n",
      "citizens' meeting to be held in the cellar of the old jail in Portsmouth\n",
      "Square, a site upon which their ancestors had gambled and Jenny Lind had\n",
      "sung. Gwynne, who was already beginning to chafe at inaction, to feel\n",
      "the excited blood shake his pulses, was revolving excuses to send his\n",
      "mother and Isabel home, when an automobile came charging down Market\n",
      "Street at a terrific rate of speed. From some distance he recognized\n",
      "Hofer sitting beside the chauffeur. Not in the least considering his\n",
      "act, he stepped in front of the crowd and made a signal. Hofer responded\n",
      "with a shout, the automobile slowed slightly, two men stood up and\n",
      "clutched Gwynne, dragging him into the machine. Gwynne's long legs flew\n",
      "backward as if he were plunging head first over an embankment, and he\n",
      "had only time to right himself, turn and shout \"Go home,\" before the\n",
      "automobile had regained its speed and was out of sight.\n",
      "Victoria turned to Isabel with wide eyes. \"It looked like kidnapping!\"\n",
      "she exclaimed.\n",
      "\"I fancy they merely want him at the citizens' meeting. No doubt they\n",
      "want every steady clear brain they can muster. I think I had better go\n",
      "out and see what has become of Paula and the children. Will you come?\"\n",
      "Victoria shook her head. \"This is all too interesting,\" she said. \"I\n",
      "must see more of it, and I am no longer afraid. When I am tired I will\n",
      "go home. Shall we agree to meet there for luncheon?\"\n",
      "Isabel nodded and started up Stockton Street alone, intending to take\n",
      "the first car that led in her sister's direction. Some of the trolley\n",
      "wires were down, but no doubt others were uninjured, and the cable-cars\n",
      "had always seemed to her as fixed as fate. She could no more conceive of\n",
      "their system being dislocated for more than an hour at a time than of\n",
      "the city burning. So far she was merely interested, and although sorry\n",
      "for the unfortunate poor, felt that the fates had conspired to do the\n",
      "city a service in cleaning out so objectionable a quarter. Of the\n",
      "millions invested in that district she did not think, but sighed as she\n",
      "thought of South Park and Rincon Hill. Still, they would have been\n",
      "obliterated in the course of events and before long; and as for the fire\n",
      "itself it would be stopped by the great walls of masonry on and near\n",
      "Market Street. She looked eastward down the deserted streets towards the\n",
      "bay, and although the vista there also was closed with flame and smoke,\n",
      "the fires were far away, and the marines were fighting it.\n",
      "She passed many people ascending and descending, some with pressed lips,\n",
      "others arguing with a certain fettered excitement against the\n",
      "pessimistic attitude. After she left the business blocks the sidewalks\n",
      "again were free of debris, although she could see the ruin within. The\n",
      "disreputable section of this street, known as the \"Red light district,\"\n",
      "was crowded with women, to whose rescue or comfort no man would seem to\n",
      "have come. Isabel looked at them with an irresistible curiosity, but no\n",
      "sense of repulsion; she even stopped and answered their eager questions\n",
      "as best she could. She was possessed with the idea that there was but\n",
      "one person in San Francisco that day, no matter what the optical\n",
      "delusion. She was not at all dazed, but utterly impersonal.\n",
      "Even in the blazing sunshine most of these women were handsome, and\n",
      "young. But all assurance was gone; when not strained and haggard from\n",
      "the recent and the menacing terror, they looked indescribably forlorn.\n",
      "But they were very quiet. Isabel heard but one excited cry, and\n",
      "something of its thrill ran along her own nerves. \"My God! The wind is\n",
      "blowing from the southeast and it's blowing strong!\"\n",
      "Isabel glanced back. It seemed to her that the great suspended waves of\n",
      "smoke, red-lined, were rolling with more energy, and they certainly were\n",
      "inclining west as well as north. She wondered, with some irritation, why\n",
      "the wind blew from the southeast when the first of the trades should be\n",
      "roaring in from the Pacific. A strong steady west wind and the fire\n",
      "would be blown towards the bay, where it could be extinguished from the\n",
      "marine boats. Every time a gust ruffled her hair she shook her head\n",
      "irritably, wondering that she had ever loved the wind.\n",
      "She reached California Street. The cars were not running. Far down where\n",
      "they should have started she saw nothing but smoke. Nor was there the\n",
      "usual rumble indicating that the cable was at work, a sound which was\n",
      "among the first of her memories. She turned west and climbed the almost\n",
      "perpendicular blocks to the summit of Nob Hill. The beautiful massive\n",
      "pile of white stone, to be known when finished as Fairmont Hotel, and\n",
      "which had already done so much to redeem the city from its architectural\n",
      "madness, looked as serene and unravaged as if it crowned a hill of\n",
      "ancient Athens; but so, for that matter, did its neighbors, two as\n",
      "faultless in their way; the others appearing even more outrageous than\n",
      "usual, inasmuch as they had had their opportunity to disappear and\n",
      "failed to take advantage of it.\n",
      "From the summit of the hill Isabel gave a hasty glance southward, then\n",
      "walked rapidly west; the fires seemed to cover far more ground than when\n",
      "she had first looked at them from Russian Hill, an hour ago.\n",
      "After she had tripped over two large paving-stones that had met in an\n",
      "upward bulge, she took more note of detail. Some of the houses had\n",
      "private cisterns, and their roofs and walls were still quite wet.\n",
      "Pretentious garden walls, and stone pillars supporting facades, had\n",
      "fallen, while next door an apparently more delicate structure was\n",
      "intact. It seemed to be a matter of foundation. And everywhere there\n",
      "were groups of silent people watching the fire. Even when the Red Cross\n",
      "men and women carried out the injured, Isabel did not hear a groan. And\n",
      "all were losing their dazed and frightened expressions. The careless\n",
      "philosophy of the city was reasserting itself, although in a more\n",
      "dignified phase.\n",
      "At Van Ness Avenue, the wide street that runs through the residence part\n",
      "of the city from north to south, Isabel shuddered for the first time,\n",
      "and, as she was ashamed to run across, stood and stared with a new sense\n",
      "of fascination at the inexplicable old earth. The street lay in a narrow\n",
      "valley, what would have been a mere canyon in the mountains, and the soil\n",
      "was loose and sandy, although the great houses sat upon most of the\n",
      "brief level and held it firm. But the stone blocks in low garden walls\n",
      "were bulging and broken, and the street itself was horribly torn. Here\n",
      "and there it had sunken, and looked as if a wave had passed over it and\n",
      "left an impress. A large stone church had fallen, one tower into the\n",
      "street and another upon the neighboring house. The stone walls of houses\n",
      "were cracked; one of the \"mansions\" had a zigzag crevice from top to\n",
      "bottom.\n",
      "And the proudest had brought forth chairs and were sitting in their\n",
      "gardens or on the pavement. Isabel recognized a girl who had been one of\n",
      "the belles of Mrs. Hofer's ball, clad in a bath-gown and a pair of\n",
      "socks, and another, noted for her gowns, passed in a wagon, a\n",
      "handkerchief tied about her head and a half-filled pillow-case on her\n",
      "lap. Isabel knew that both had lived in one of the beautiful private\n",
      "hotels on the avenue, and she had already heard that it was so badly\n",
      "wrecked that the guests had been thankful to get out alive and had not\n",
      "ventured to return for their clothes. The stately building had been run\n",
      "up in a night, its feet set in sand, and the wonder was it was not lying\n",
      "across the avenue.\n",
      "Many of the refugees had already reached this third and last wide street\n",
      "of refuge, and although the greater number were still down at the\n",
      "southern end, others had pushed on, intending to walk to the Presidio,\n",
      "where they were likely to be fed. They were resting on their cumbrous\n",
      "belongings, strange groups, unkempt and half dressed. Many of the\n",
      "householders had sent within for food, and one wealthy dame, whose maid\n",
      "had had time to build her coiffure and groom her properly, sat with a\n",
      "dirty frowsy baby on her lap and was coaxing it to take milk from a\n",
      "spoon, its bottle having been overlooked in the flight. The mother was\n",
      "sitting on the bureau her husband had rescued, by no means abashed, nor\n",
      "even surprised.\n",
      "Isabel crossed the street and ascended and descended again, traversed\n",
      "several blocks to the north, and finally approached the house in which\n",
      "the Stones had their apartment. Although high-perched, it was uninjured,\n",
      "and as Isabel climbed the hill she saw Paula and her children seated,\n",
      "with many others, on the long flight of steps. Paula waved her hand and\n",
      "walked down composedly to meet her sister. She was dressed, laced, and\n",
      "painted. A sufficient time had elapsed since the earthquake to permit\n",
      "her ruling passion to regain its throne.\n",
      "\"Well, I am glad to see you!\" She greeted Isabel with something of the\n",
      "grand air. She felt almost pompous with the sense of playing her part in\n",
      "a great event, fancied herself, perhaps, its central figure. \"Of course,\n",
      "I knew you were all right up there, especially as we came off fairly\n",
      "well. But you should have been here. You've missed it!\"\n",
      "\"I know,\" said Isabel, humbly. \"But I am glad you were not hurt. And not\n",
      "frightened?\"\n",
      "\"Oh, fearfully. And being up so many flights of stairs made it seem so\n",
      "much worse. But Lyster and I managed to get out of bed and into the\n",
      "nursery before it was half over, and hold the children in the doorways.\n",
      "I didn't make a fool of myself like so many others, and run out in the\n",
      "street before I was dressed; my hair was up on pins. Lys was more\n",
      "frightened than I was--it's a wonder he has any nerves at all--and now\n",
      "that there are so many fires he is fearfully excited at the idea that\n",
      "all his favorite haunts may go. He has gone down-town to see what is\n",
      "happening--also,\" in a happy afterthought, \"to try and borrow some\n",
      "money. He literally had not ten cents in his pocket. We have some in the\n",
      "bank for a wonder, but everybody says the banks will go, and also that\n",
      "there will be hard times.\"\n",
      "Isabel handed over her purse mechanically. \"Victoria and Elton have\n",
      "plenty, I shall not need it,\" she said. But the desire to save Mrs.\n",
      "Stone's feelings was superfluous. The purse disappeared with a polite\n",
      "\"Thanks, dear,\" and Paula hastily changed the subject, lest the luxury\n",
      "of a carriage for the return to Russian Hill should appeal to Isabel.\n",
      "\"Of course you'll go back to the ranch where you can be comfortable,\"\n",
      "she remarked.\n",
      "\"I have no plan. The launch is ready for us, but it will depend upon the\n",
      "others. Should you care to go to the ranch? I don't suppose you are in\n",
      "any danger from fire, out here, but things may be very uncomfortable for\n",
      "a time.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, I'll take the risk,\" said Paula, easily. \"I should be bored to\n",
      "death up there, and here there are so many people to talk to. I have\n",
      "heard about fifty experiences this morning, and all fearfully\n",
      "interesting. I guess we'll make out. It will only be for a day or two\n",
      "anyhow, and everybody that has food in the house is offering to share\n",
      "with the rest. I never have much on hand, but Mrs. Brooks, who lives\n",
      "under me, always keeps her store-room filled, and has invited me to\n",
      "lunch. You had better stop, too.\"\n",
      "\"I have promised Victoria to return. Just suppose the fire should come\n",
      "out here, what should you do?\"\n",
      "\"Oh, take a mattress or two out to the Presidio. It's not far, and would\n",
      "be a regular picnic. But it won't.\"\n",
      "\"Well, I'll go, then. If you change your mind you can have the launch.\n",
      "Only come to me first. Mr. Clatt is standing over it with a\n",
      "six-shooter.\"\n",
      "\"Thanks. Sorry you won't come in. Lys won't sit down for about a week,\n",
      "he's _that_ nervous, so you'll probably see him up on the Hill.\"\n",
      "Isabel started for home, and when she reached Fillmore Street discovered\n",
      "that she was tired. It was then that she regretted not having reserved a\n",
      "dollar or two; but no doubt Victoria was at home by this time. She found\n",
      "a livery-stable, and asked the proprietor, lounging in the entrance, if\n",
      "he could send her to the foot of her bluff.\n",
      "\"Yes, for fifty dollars,\" he said, coolly. Fillmore Street was a\n",
      "prosperous slum, another brief level between two steep acclivities. It\n",
      "was not yet aware of the proud destiny that awaited it, that for the\n",
      "next year or more it was to be the teeming centre of the abbreviated\n",
      "city's life, but there never was a time when it was burdened with\n",
      "manners, or the grand point of view. When Isabel stared, the man\n",
      "continued: \"Yes, ma'am! Fifty's the ticket. And two hours later it may\n",
      "be five hundred. Some people are getting mighty nervous, and I've let\n",
      "five hacks and buggies already, at my own figure, to them as wants to\n",
      "get out of town quick.\"\n",
      "Isabel turned her back on him, and climbed and descended again. Lower\n",
      "Van Ness Avenue was even more torn and lumpy than where she had crossed\n",
      "it at California Street, and hundreds of the South of Market Street\n",
      "refugees were sitting or lying in the middle of the street, worn out but\n",
      "stolid. Just beyond, she caught up with a teamster, who, noticing the\n",
      "fatigue in her eyes, stopped his horses and offered her a \"lift,\"\n",
      "provided she was \"going his way.\"\n",
      "Isabel gratefully climbed to his high perch, after stating that she had\n",
      "no money, and being royally silenced.\n",
      "\"Oh, shucks!\" said the man. \"I guess this is the time to do other folks\n",
      "a good turn. You'd do the same for me, I'll bet. What do you think of\n",
      "this business, anyhow?\"\n",
      "Isabel replied hopefully, but he shook his head.\n",
      "\"City's doomed. Far as Van Ness, anyhow. Nothin' ain't goin' to stop\n",
      "that fire but water, and water's just what they haven't got. Lord! to\n",
      "think of that bay on three sides of the city. Talk about the Ancient\n",
      "Mariner. I don't live in the city, but I'll be sorry to see it go. Lord!\n",
      "warn't that a shake? I was flung plumb out of bed and against the wall,\n",
      "and the house next to mine, or the one I war in, went plumb out into the\n",
      "middle of the street. Lord! what a yellin' there was inside! Nobody\n",
      "hurt, but one woman went plumb out'r her mind. They've got her tied to\n",
      "the bed-post now. And what a lootin' of saloons there was until the\n",
      "soldiers marched in! Now, I hear, that there mayor has issued an order,\n",
      "which is to be pasted up all over, that any man caught lootin' anything,\n",
      "saloons or otherwise, is to be shot dead and no questions asked. Good\n",
      "job, that. I guess we're in for high old times, miss. I'm makin' for\n",
      "Oakland, where I live. I brought in a load last evenin' and stopped\n",
      "over. Some of my friends live down by the ferry, and I'll pick them up,\n",
      "if they want to get out. Don't you want to come along? My wife and me'll\n",
      "be glad to put you up if you can't do any better.\"\n",
      "Isabel thanked him warmly, and assured him that she would be safe in any\n",
      "case, then discovered a loose half-dollar in the pocket of her jacket.\n",
      "The man accepted it philosophically.\n",
      "\"You were welcome to the ride, but I'm not the one to say nay to a bit\n",
      "of silver so long as you say you're not hard up yourself. Guess it'll\n",
      "come in handy. Well, s'long. Good luck to you. I've enjoyed your society\n",
      "very much.\"\n",
      "XII\n",
      "The teamster had deposited her at Taylor and Jackson streets, and as she\n",
      "passed the Trennahans' door it occurred to her to ask how they fared.\n",
      "The house appeared to be uninjured, but the electric bell was useless,\n",
      "and it was not until she had knocked several times that an old Mexican\n",
      "servant answered the summons. Then she learned that the family had left\n",
      "for Menlo Park in their touring car immediately after the earthquake, as\n",
      "the boys were at the country-house with their tutor. The woman had been\n",
      "maid for many years to Mrs. Polk and had lived with Magdalena since her\n",
      "aunt's death. She was a privileged character, and during Isabel's visit\n",
      "had accepted her relationship to the house of Yorba and waited on her\n",
      "personally.\n",
      "\"So tired you look,\" she said. \"Come in, no?\" Then, as the invitation\n",
      "was declined, she leaned her stout shapeless figure against the\n",
      "door-frame and begged Isabel for an account of her experience. Isabel\n",
      "gave it briefly, and the old woman shook her head. \"So terreeblay\n",
      "thing!\" she sighed. \"Seventy years I live in California and this the\n",
      "more bad earthquake I never feel. My mother she feel the great\n",
      "earthquake of 1812 in the south, when the padres plant a long straight\n",
      "branch in the middle of the square of San Gabriel, and it never stop\n",
      "shake for four months. Ay yi, California! I theenk we all go into the\n",
      "bay this morning, and I fall down twice when I run to see how little\n",
      "Senorita Inez she feeling. Ay yi!\"\n",
      "\"Why did you not go to the country?\"\n",
      "\"And who take care the house? The car come back bime-by for the other\n",
      "servants, but I no go. Si, I can go in the train--then--perhaps. But no\n",
      "in automobilia. Is devil, no less.\"\n",
      "\"Well, if you should be frightened come up to me,\" and Isabel went on\n",
      "hurriedly to her own home, suddenly reminded of the uncertainty of her\n",
      "relative's nerves. But Victoria was standing on the porch staring\n",
      "outward with such an intensity of gaze that she took no notice of\n",
      "Isabel's approach. And when Isabel reached her side, she too stood\n",
      "silent for a time. _The Call_ Building was on fire. This square tower of\n",
      "seventeen stories and a dome, with some seventy windows on each side,\n",
      "had caught fire at the top, and as the flames devoured the contents of\n",
      "one floor as quickly as possible that they might dart down another\n",
      "flight and gorge themselves anew, in an incredibly short time the two\n",
      "hundred windows in sight, and no doubt those in the rear, were spouting\n",
      "flames like the mouths of so many cannon: each sharply defined, owing to\n",
      "the indestructible nature of the walls. Volumes of white smoke poured\n",
      "upward to be lost in the black clouds above. At times the fire and\n",
      "smoke, on either side, torn by the wind, seemed to dance and gyrate in a\n",
      "Bacchanalian revel, taking monstrous forms, that exploded in showers of\n",
      "sparks, glittering like the fabled California sands. Above the burning\n",
      "district the smoke clouds changed form constantly. Sometimes they reeled\n",
      "along like colossal water-spouts. The roar of the fire waxed louder as\n",
      "one listened to it: a deep persistent energetic roar, as of a sea\n",
      "climbing over a land its time had come to devour.\n",
      "Suddenly a curtain of smoke swept down and obliterated the scene,\n",
      "conveying a sense of respite, challenging the memory, although a moment\n",
      "later it was shot with a million sparks.\n",
      "Victoria announced briefly that they were to have lunch of a sort, but\n",
      "for her part she would prefer a bath.\n",
      "A bath, however, was out of the question, and, without washing the\n",
      "cinders from their faces and hands, they sat down to beefsteak fried on\n",
      "one of the oil-stoves used for heating the Mansard story, and canned\n",
      "vegetables. That much indulgence they might have permitted themselves,\n",
      "but human nature is prone to extremes, and they were tuned to a severe\n",
      "economy that might embrace more than water for some weeks to come.\n",
      "Isabel sent a plate of sandwiches and a bottle of beer down to Mr.\n",
      "Clatt, and the servant returned with the information that the faithful\n",
      "wharfinger was sitting on a chair in front of the launch, a pistol on\n",
      "his lap; and that already a small crowd was crouched like buzzards in\n",
      "front of him. Isabel asked Victoria if she cared to retreat, but the\n",
      "older woman shook her head.\n",
      "\"Do you?\" she asked.\n",
      "\"Oh no. I shall remain until the last minute, certainly until I know\n",
      "what Elton's plans are. If the launch is seized we can go down to Fort\n",
      "Mason or out to the Presidio. Every one is in the same boat. I should\n",
      "hate being too comfortable. But I don't think you should sleep\n",
      "out-of-doors. It is always damp at night.\"\n",
      "\"I can stand as much as you can. I am quite fit again. And this is the\n",
      "first time, for heaven knows how many years, that anything has\n",
      "interested me. I shall stay till the last minute; and surely no fire\n",
      "could climb this hill. Did I tell you that Mr. Trennahan came up at once\n",
      "and asked me to go to Menlo Park with them? Ungrateful--but I have not\n",
      "thought of it since.\"\n",
      "Isabel announced her intention to take a nap. \"No one knows what may\n",
      "happen to-night,\" she said. \"And I feel as if I had not slept for a\n",
      "week.\"\n",
      "She fell asleep at once. Lady Victoria awakened her by bursting\n",
      "unceremoniously into her room.\n",
      "\"You must get up and look!\" she cried. \"The Palace Hotel and the other\n",
      "big newspaper buildings are on fire. The sight is something awful--and\n",
      "wonderful.\"\n",
      "Isabel ran to the window. All the valley was a rolling sea of flame, and\n",
      "all space seemed to be filled with enormous surging billows of smoke.\n",
      "From every window of the Palace Hotel, an immense square building of\n",
      "some seven stories, from the great newspaper buildings, and from other\n",
      "brick and stone structures near by, tongues of flame were leaping; the\n",
      "wooden buildings were mere shapeless furnaces. Again a volume of smoke\n",
      "descended, and for the moment nothing was to be seen but a red blur\n",
      "somewhere in the midst of rolling black.\n",
      "Victoria communicated to Isabel the information she had received from\n",
      "the neighbors, always coming and going. People were pouring out of the\n",
      "city, not only by the Southern Pacific boats to Oakland, and indirectly\n",
      "to Berkeley and Alameda, but by freight-boats and launches to the Marin\n",
      "towns. They were obliged to make a long detour round the base of the\n",
      "northern hills, as the water-front and the streets behind were a roaring\n",
      "furnace, although the fires had not crossed East Street. All houses in\n",
      "the towns across the bay had opened to the refugees, tents had been\n",
      "erected in the public squares, and emergency hospitals had been started\n",
      "before nine o'clock. The militia had been called out to assist the\n",
      "regulars, and also the Cadet Battalion of the State University. A\n",
      "Citizens' Patrol had been formed to protect the still unburned\n",
      "districts, each man provided with arms at the Presidio. People on the\n",
      "lower slopes were now in full flight towards the western parks and\n",
      "hills, as well as the Presidio, many being under the impression that the\n",
      "ferry-boats were not running. It was doubtful if a hotel or a\n",
      "boarding-house would harbor a soul that night; not east of Van Ness\n",
      "Avenue, at least, and many in that region were preparing to sleep in the\n",
      "Park and squares, lest the fire attack them from the south. Refugees,\n",
      "exhausted, were lying on the doorsteps and in the streets of the Western\n",
      "Addition.\n",
      "Victoria relapsed into silence and Isabel gazed down upon the beautiful\n",
      "terrible scene--the curtain had rolled upward again--at the enormous\n",
      "tongues of flame leaping from every window, the showers of golden\n",
      "sparks, the swooping and soaring clouds, many of them white, with\n",
      "convoluted edges, and faintly tinted like the day smoke of Vesuvius.\n",
      "These curled white masses rolled among the black waves towards the west,\n",
      "and the low deep roar waxed louder as one listened to it.\n",
      "All the wooden bow-windows of the Palace Hotel had been eaten off, but\n",
      "it would be hours before the stoutly built old hotel ceased to feed the\n",
      "flames. Sometimes sheets of fire seemed to drive from the apertures\n",
      "across the great width of Market Street, to be beaten back by a solid\n",
      "wall of flame. In the intense clear yellow light that bathed the street\n",
      "Isabel could see the twisted car tracks. More than once she fancied she\n",
      "saw a prostrate body, but it may have been an achievement of the\n",
      "shifting flames, and certainly nothing living moved down there. The\n",
      "mounted officers and their men were patrolling the blocks along all the\n",
      "northern front of the fire.\n",
      "\"Are you not in the least worried about Elton?\" asked Isabel, abruptly.\n",
      "\"Not a bit. I never worried about him when he was a child. He was always\n",
      "the most agile and ready youngster I ever saw.\"\n",
      "\"But he is very venturesome. He might be caught in one of those furnaces\n",
      "as well as another, or killed by falling bricks.\"\n",
      "\"He is a man of destiny,\" said Victoria indifferently. \"He will live to\n",
      "accomplish what he was born for.\"\n",
      "Isabel, in truth, found worry as impossible as any other common emotion,\n",
      "nevertheless thought it odd that he did not come to them for a moment or\n",
      "send a message. She could appreciate his wholly masculine mood, his\n",
      "temporary indifference to the charms of her sex, but he had an ingrained\n",
      "sense of responsibility, and was more considerate than the average man.\n",
      "Lady Victoria returned to her vantage-point on the veranda, and Isabel\n",
      "went down to the garden fence where the three Japs were standing, and\n",
      "asked them if they intended to remain--half the servants had already\n",
      "fled from the city. Two replied that later in the day they should go to\n",
      "Oakland where they had friends. Isabel told them that she should not\n",
      "part with what little money there was in the house, and they answered\n",
      "politely that they expected to wait for their wages. The oldest of the\n",
      "three, a respectable man of thirty, who looked like, and no doubt was,\n",
      "a student, announced his intention to remain.\n",
      "\"I can cook,\" he added. \"Not well, but perhaps well enough for a few\n",
      "days. And perhaps if we are driven out I may go to the country with you.\n",
      "I should be willing to work for anything you could pay me until things\n",
      "were restored to their normal condition--if you would be good enough to\n",
      "give me my evenings for study.\"\n",
      "Isabel promised him the protection of her ranch-house, and stood talking\n",
      "to him for some time. His English was unusually correct and his remarks\n",
      "were more intelligent than those of the average man of her acquaintance.\n",
      "He told her something of Japanese earthquakes, and was good enough to\n",
      "add that he had never felt quite so violent or so peculiar a series of\n",
      "earth movements as California had achieved that morning. He was curious\n",
      "to see the result as recorded on the seismograph, and to know at what\n",
      "hour it registered in Japan.\n",
      "\"I think Professor Omori will come over,\" he said, modestly. \"This\n",
      "earthquake will interest him very much. He will wish to study the\n",
      "ground.\"\n",
      "\"Were you not frightened?\" asked Isabel, curiously.\n",
      "\"I appreciated the danger, but frightened--no, miss, I think I have\n",
      "never felt frightened. But I do not like fire. I have seen Tokio burn. I\n",
      "shall walk about constantly and see that it does not steal upon us from\n",
      "the north or west. Some silly person might make a fire, and all the\n",
      "chimneys must be cracked.\"\n",
      "\"I feel much relieved to know that you will patrol,\" said Isabel,\n",
      "wondering if she were being gracious to a prince. \"Would you mind going\n",
      "up to the top of the hill and asking some one if he knows whether all\n",
      "the injured were taken from the Mechanics' Pavilion? It is blazing like\n",
      "a wood pile.\"\n",
      "He went up the hill and returned with the information that all the\n",
      "patients, as well as the doctors and nurses, had been taken out, the\n",
      "last of them while the roof was blazing, and conveyed in automobiles to\n",
      "other emergency hospitals far away; and that the prisoners in the City\n",
      "Hall had been transported, manacled, to the army prisons in the same\n",
      "manner.\n",
      "\"One of the gentlemen said he saw Mr. Gwynne running an automobile full\n",
      "of nurses and patients--one of Mr. Hofer's machines,\" he added. \"And\n",
      "that he returned twice at least. All the young men that own machines are\n",
      "acting very well, they say, transporting the injured, and making\n",
      "themselves generally useful. Many are on the roofs of the greater\n",
      "buildings with the firemen fighting the fire with blankets, and hose\n",
      "attached to the cisterns. A few buildings have been saved in that way,\n",
      "but not many, and more or less of the water has to be turned on the men,\n",
      "who catch fire repeatedly from the sparks.\"\n",
      "Isabel went into the house and put on her hat. \"I cannot keep still any\n",
      "longer,\" she said to Victoria, a moment later. \"And now I am quite\n",
      "rested. I shall go down and see Mrs. Hofer, and reconnoitre for myself.\n",
      "If Elton should come, ask him to wait for me here--he must need a\n",
      "rest--or walk down Taylor Street.\"\n",
      "XIII\n",
      "She found her lower neighbors still sitting on their doorsteps or\n",
      "standing in groups, but was told that many more had already gone out to\n",
      "the Western Addition with their valuables, fearing that the fire might\n",
      "come up the southern or eastern slopes before night. A large touring car\n",
      "was standing in front of the Hofers' door. The children and their nurses\n",
      "were in it, and Mr. Toole came out and took his place as Isabel reached\n",
      "the house. He greeted her for the first time since she had known him\n",
      "without a smile; and he looked very old and sad. Isabel heard Mrs.\n",
      "Hofer's light high rapid voice within. She was standing in the large\n",
      "drawing-room, giving orders to a group of servants. When she saw Isabel\n",
      "she cried out as if confronted with a ghost.\n",
      "\"Oh!\" she exclaimed, but not kissing her as usual; her mind apparently\n",
      "was divided into many parts. \"I am relieved to see that _you_ are all\n",
      "right. I didn't know what might have happened up State. Did you _ever_?\n",
      "Well!--Great old country this. Talk about living on the side of\n",
      "Vesuvius. And now everything is going, everything!\"\n",
      "\"I keep hoping for a change of wind.\"\n",
      "\"Perhaps, but I've pretty well given it up. We are in disgrace to-day,\n",
      "sure enough. And anyhow Mr. Hofer has lost millions, millions!\n",
      "However--\" She recovered herself with a bound. \"He made them, so I\n",
      "guess he can make more. And do you know what he's thinking about\n",
      "already? He burst in here half an hour ago--as black as your hat--with\n",
      "orders that I should take the family down to Burlingame at once, and\n",
      "then began talking about the Burnham plans, and the opportunity to clean\n",
      "up the city politically. There's a raging idealist for you. And do you\n",
      "know what he and Mr. Gwynne are up to now? Carrying dynamite, no less,\n",
      "between Fort Mason and the fire line. The two of them are running an\n",
      "automobile apiece and have put themselves at the disposal of the\n",
      "authorities. Nice thing for me to be thinking of all night. Don't you\n",
      "want to come along?\"\n",
      "Isabel shook her head.\n",
      "\"Well, I'll move on then--before they change their minds and impress my\n",
      "car. So far I have a gracious permit to keep it. The servants have\n",
      "buried the silver and the pictures, but--\" She glanced at the beautiful\n",
      "frieze, which, without its electric lights, looked a mere blur of blue\n",
      "and black, then shrugged her shoulders. \"I just won't believe my house\n",
      "will go,\" she said, defiantly; \"not till the last minute, anyhow. When\n",
      "the fire's over, or Mr. Hofer lets me, I'll come back and do something\n",
      "for those poor wretches that have been burned out. Gather up what food\n",
      "there is to be had in the country, and start an eating station or\n",
      "something. Mr. Hofer says food will come pouring in from every direction\n",
      "presently, and then they will need organizers. I'm good at that. Can I\n",
      "rely on you? It will be an experience, anyhow; and of course it's my\n",
      "place to do that sort of thing. Besides, I do feel terribly sorry for\n",
      "those poor things, and I won't be able to sit still for a month.\"\n",
      "\"You can count on me. When this is over I shall find you somehow.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, don't worry. The newspapers won't miss anything. They're burned\n",
      "out, but I hear that the editors are already over in Oakland scurrying\n",
      "round after a plant. Well, _adios_. If you say the word I'll send the\n",
      "car back for you--although I doubt if it would pass a squad without\n",
      "those children in it. I suppose it would hold several tons of dynamite!\n",
      "Heigh-ho, I suppose it is all in the day's work. What can you expect if\n",
      "you live in an earthquake country?\" They had reached the pavement and\n",
      "she put her lips close to Isabel's ear. \"I'd like to get out of the\n",
      "damned place and never see it again,\" she whispered. \"I'll keep a stiff\n",
      "upper lip, but those are my sentiments and I guess I have company.\"\n",
      "She stepped lightly into the car, nodded with a grim gayety, and in\n",
      "another moment had disappeared round the corner of Taylor and California\n",
      "streets.\n",
      "Isabel started down the hill, and almost immediately met Anne\n",
      "Montgomery. She had not recognized her as they approached each other,\n",
      "for the glare was in her eyes; but Miss Montgomery ran forward and\n",
      "kissed her.\n",
      "\"What on earth did you come to this God-forsaken place for, when you had\n",
      "the country to stay in?\" she demanded. \"Oh, Lady Victoria? I did not\n",
      "know she was here. Just come with me and look at a sight.\"\n",
      "She put her arm through Isabel's and led her rapidly for several blocks\n",
      "along California Street, then down Hyde towards moving columns of\n",
      "people. The fire was far south of these refugees as yet, but they looked\n",
      "down every cross street and saw it; and more than once during their slow\n",
      "flight they had seen the soldiers at the visible end of each long vista\n",
      "move a block farther north. \"I tramped a long way with them,\" said Miss\n",
      "Montgomery, \"carrying things for a woman I never saw before. Then a man\n",
      "took the burden over and I started up the hill to see how some friends\n",
      "were faring.\"\n",
      "From this point they could hear the roar and crackle of the fire and the\n",
      "crashing of walls; but even more formidable was that tramping of\n",
      "thousands of feet, the scraping of trunks and furniture on the tracks\n",
      "and stones. Isabel, still feeling like a palimpsest, lingered for an\n",
      "hour looking at these refugees. They were vastly different, in all but\n",
      "their impotence, from those of the early morning. Hundreds were from the\n",
      "\"boarding-house district\"; others were householders; a large number, no\n",
      "doubt, owned their carriages or automobiles, but those had been\n",
      "impressed long since. It was a well and a carefully dressed crowd, for\n",
      "by this time nearly every one had recovered from the shock of the\n",
      "earthquake; many forgotten it, no doubt, in the new horror. They had not\n",
      "the blank expression of the poor, dazed by the second calamity following\n",
      "so close upon the heels of the first, but their lips were pressed, eyes\n",
      "were straining towards the distant goal, and all would have been pale\n",
      "but for the glare of the fire. Fortunately for most of them, men as well\n",
      "as women, they had either children, pets, or even more cumbersome\n",
      "belongings to claim their immediate attention; no time for either\n",
      "thought or despair. They pushed trunks to which skates had been\n",
      "attached, or pulled them by ropes; they trundled sewing-machines and\n",
      "pieces of small furniture, laden with bundles. Many carried\n",
      "pillow-cases, into which they had stuffed a favorite dress and hat, an\n",
      "extra pair of boots and a change of underclothing, some valuable\n",
      "bibelot or bundle of documents; to say nothing of their jewels and what\n",
      "food they could lay hands on. Several women wore their furs, as an\n",
      "easier way of saving them, and children carried their dolls. Their state\n",
      "of mind was elemental. They lived acutely in the present moment and\n",
      "looked neither behind nor before--save to a goal of safety. Misfortune\n",
      "had descended upon them, and ruin no doubt would follow, but for the\n",
      "present they asked no more than to save what they could carry or propel,\n",
      "and to get far beyond that awful fire. The refinements of sentiment and\n",
      "all complexity were forgotten; they indulged in nothing so futile as\n",
      "complaint, nor even conversation. And the sense of the common calamity\n",
      "sustained them, no doubt, deindividualized them for the hour. Soon after\n",
      "they became their normal selves once more, and accepted the hard\n",
      "conditions of the following weeks with the philosophy that was to be\n",
      "expected of them. But underneath all the recovered gayety and defiant\n",
      "pride of the later time more than one spirit was sprained, haunted with\n",
      "a sense of dislocation, permanently saddened by the loss not of fortune\n",
      "but of personal treasures, of old homes full of life-long associations,\n",
      "never to be replaced nor regained. Many no doubt were better off for\n",
      "losing those old anchors that held them to the past and emphasized their\n",
      "years, besides keeping their sorrows green, but others had one reason\n",
      "less for living. Nevertheless the philosophy born of a lifetime in an\n",
      "earthquake country, of the electric climate, of their isolation, as well\n",
      "as the good Anglo-Saxon strain in so many of them, brought a genuine\n",
      "rebound to all physically capable of it, both old and young. But to-day\n",
      "they were primitive--and entirely human. They helped one another, the\n",
      "stronger carrying the weaker's burdens as a matter of course. The men\n",
      "were bent almost double with increasing properties.\n",
      "Isabel felt neither pity nor admiration for them; they were a mere unit,\n",
      "these thousands reduced to their primal component, the third fact in the\n",
      "great day of facts.\n",
      "Suddenly, however, she caught sight of Lyster Stone. He carried a baby\n",
      "on one arm and several rolls of painted canvas under the other. Beside\n",
      "him walked the mother pushing a loaded crib; and behind him the artist\n",
      "friend, to whose aid he had evidently gone, dragged a large canvas trunk\n",
      "bound with an ingenious system of ropes. Stone nodded gayly when he saw\n",
      "Isabel.\n",
      "\"Hallo!\" he cried. \"I was going for you later on. We'll all sleep out\n",
      "to-night. Better come along.\" Then as Isabel only shook her head he\n",
      "said, hurriedly: \"Awfully sorry I forgot--promised Gwynne I'd go up and\n",
      "tell you he was in for a long day's work--transporting hospital patients\n",
      "and hauling dynamite. He sent peremptory orders that you and his mother\n",
      "were to go to the country with the afternoon tide.\"\n",
      "The crowd bore him on and Isabel and Anne walked up the hill again,\n",
      "meeting other streams of refugees, but thinner, as most of them\n",
      "preferred the easier slopes. Isabel looked at Anne curiously. There was\n",
      "an unusual restlessness about her, nothing of the rudimentary expression\n",
      "of the crowd. Isabel was wondering if her apparent and unusual spirits\n",
      "might be due to the fact that her flat was in the Western Addition, and\n",
      "that she had hired a wagon at the first alarm of fire and carried her\n",
      "silver to the Presidio, when Anne suddenly began to explain herself.\n",
      "\"Do you know,\" she broke out, \"I have a wonderful sense of\n",
      "freedom!--of--of--hope. Something has happened at last. All the ruts\n",
      "have been ploughed over. Life will never be the same here, in my time at\n",
      "least. It will be like beginning all over again, with a hundred barely\n",
      "imagined possibilities and an equal chance for every one. It may be a\n",
      "reprehensible thing--to feel as if the destruction of your city had set\n",
      "your individual soul free--but I do, and that's the end of it. And I can\n",
      "tell you I've seen that _expression_ in the eyes of many a man in the\n",
      "last few hours. Not in those of the older men, perhaps, for they wear\n",
      "out early enough in this climate, anyhow, and those that are close upon\n",
      "sixty don't look as if they had much left to live for--although I've\n",
      "seen a few flying about as if they had dropped thirty years; its all a\n",
      "matter of temperament and physique. But for the rest of us! The still\n",
      "energetic men, and the women that have been cankered with the tedium\n",
      "vitae, and have the brains and brawn to work. It will be the Fifties all\n",
      "over again--not only something more than a bare living in prospect, but\n",
      "a constant, exciting, interest in life. I saw a good many men, just\n",
      "after the earthquake, looking as if they had believed the end of the\n",
      "world had come, but they braced up directly the city was threatened by\n",
      "something they could pit themselves against. Every man worth his salt is\n",
      "fighting fire, rescuing the helpless, dragging mattresses out to the\n",
      "hills and Park, and helping the women down here save their belongings.\n",
      "All with automobiles and carriages are helping the authorities and\n",
      "hospitals. Political factions and personal enemies are working side by\n",
      "side, particularly down on the fire line. Even the mayor has won a day's\n",
      "respect from his fellow-citizens, although I'm told he's terribly torn\n",
      "between the Committee of Fifty and the military authorities on the one\n",
      "hand, who want to blow up a wide zone, and the property-holders who\n",
      "won't have their precious possessions sacrificed when the wind may\n",
      "change any minute. Meanwhile the fire has a headway that will give it\n",
      "the best part of the city. I never felt so alive in my life; so vividly\n",
      "in the present. Can you remember the name of a book you have read, that\n",
      "there is any world outside these seven square miles?\"\n",
      "\"Yesterday is a mere dream and to-morrow is only a bare possibility! The\n",
      "Fifties! I feel as if we were at the beginning of things on another\n",
      "planet. I shall never trouble my head with problems or psychology again.\n",
      "We are mere dancing midgets on the scalp of stupendous forces that we do\n",
      "not even dimly apprehend. Earth lets us play until her patience is\n",
      "exhausted with our pretentions as mere human beings, at our insane\n",
      "delusion that the intellectual are not only the equal but the superior\n",
      "of the physical forces; and then she merely shakes herself, and the\n",
      "wisest is as helpless as the idiot, the prince even worse off than the\n",
      "pauper because he has a bigger house to run out of. They all dance to\n",
      "her tune like so many wooden marionettes. Hofer is no better off than\n",
      "his blacksmith--whose savings are probably in the fireproof vault of\n",
      "some bank, while I happen to know that more than one millionaire has not\n",
      "insured his Class A buildings, thinking the expense unnecessary. No\n",
      "wonder you have a sense of freedom. So have I. We are dancing to the\n",
      "tune of the unseen forces. They will do the thinking. I wonder,\n",
      "by-the-way, if deep down in the brain of that fleeing ruined tide of\n",
      "elemental beings there is not a prick of gratified vanity that they are\n",
      "in the midst of a great and horrible experience? We have been reading so\n",
      "much lately of the horrors in Russia, we have read, all our lives, of\n",
      "horrors and atrocities somewhere, and this State has grinned at us so\n",
      "unintermittently. Now we, too, are actors in a great life-and-death\n",
      "drama. I don't fancy any one is doing even that much analysis, but I\n",
      "can't help thinking that the vague appreciation of the fact sustains\n",
      "them in a way--possibly gives them a calm sense of superiority to the\n",
      "rest of the world----Look at this.\"\n",
      "They had reached Jackson Street on the flat of Nob Hill. It was now\n",
      "evening and the exodus from Chinatown had begun. The Mongolians were\n",
      "streaming up from their threatened quarter, and, like the others,\n",
      "tramping silently out to the Presidio. The merchants had put on their\n",
      "fine clothes, and their families--exposed to the Occidental eye for the\n",
      "first time--wore gorgeous garments of bright silks covered with\n",
      "embroideries. The poor little respectable wives tottered along on their\n",
      "foolish feet, held up by their lords or their \"big-footed\"\n",
      "serving-women, while their children trudged along uncomplainingly and\n",
      "stared at the fire with big expressionless eyes. Mingling freely with\n",
      "the wealthy autocrats of Chinatown were the coolies, and the\n",
      "disreputable women with which the quarter swarmed. The Chinese rarely\n",
      "import their wives. The coolies wore their blue blouses and soft felt\n",
      "hats, and the women had painted their faces and built up their hair as\n",
      "usual, shining tower-like coiffures stuck with large-lobed pins, cheap\n",
      "or costly, according to their grade. All were as stolid as their own\n",
      "wooden gods. They would have looked like a solemn procession on a festa\n",
      "day had it not been for the bundles and strong-chests they carried.\n",
      "\"Come up to dinner, such as it is,\" said Isabel, to Anne. \"What are you\n",
      "going to do to-night?\"\n",
      "\"Camp down in the sand-lots by Fort Mason and see what I can do for\n",
      "those poor refugees. There will be great suffering, I am afraid. Many\n",
      "women should be in hospital with every attention; and with all this\n",
      "excitement who knows what may happen? I fancy either a tent-hospital\n",
      "will be erected, or the worst cases will be taken into the fort. I am a\n",
      "good nurse, and I told the Leader I should be there. There will be many\n",
      "children to look after, too. The parents, the best of them, won't be up\n",
      "to much.\"\n",
      "\"Perhaps I will go down later. But I shall wait at the house until I\n",
      "have seen Mr. Gwynne--he may need food, or be hurt in any of a dozen\n",
      "ways. If you see him--and no doubt you will, if you are to be at the\n",
      "fort--tell him that I have not gone to the country and have no intention\n",
      "of going.\"\n",
      "XIV\n",
      "They had passed members of the Citizens' Patrol on every block, and they\n",
      "found one pacing the plank walk on Russian Hill. He told them that the\n",
      "edict had gone forth that not so much as a candle should be lit in a\n",
      "house that night and that all cooking must be done out-of-doors. The\n",
      "spectacled Jap was boiling soup on one of the oil stoves, which he had\n",
      "carried into the garden and half surrounded by a screen. Beside him was\n",
      "what looked like an open newly-dug grave, and the girls, startled,\n",
      "demanded what it meant.\n",
      "Sugihara, apparently, never smiled, but his eyes flickered. \"Before\n",
      "Cusha and Kuranaga went I made them dig a hole for the silver,\" he said.\n",
      "\"It is too heavy for the launch. If we are driven away, I will cut your\n",
      "ancestors from their frames and take them with us.\"\n",
      "\"Well, you are a treasure,\" said Isabel, with a sigh. \"You shall do\n",
      "nothing but read when you get to the ranch.\"\n",
      "Lady Victoria was pacing slowly up and down the porch, her eyes seldom\n",
      "wandering from the fire. When dinner was ready, she merely shook her\n",
      "head impatiently, and Isabel and her guest sat down in the little\n",
      "tower-room, which was brilliantly illuminated from below. Sugihara\n",
      "had made a very good soup of canned corn and tomatoes and had fried\n",
      "bits of meat and potato. There was little conversation. The dynamiting\n",
      "was now something more than sporadic. The detonations were so terrific\n",
      "that it was not difficult for the San Franciscans to imagine\n",
      "themselves--supposing they had a grain of imagination left--in a\n",
      "besieged city. Isabel suggested, and Anne agreed with her, that they\n",
      "might have been far worse off than they were; nature at her extremest is\n",
      "never so pitiless as the human brute when the lust to kill is on him.\n",
      "Isabel prepared the remains of the feast for Mr. Clatt, and asked\n",
      "Sugihara if he would object to relieving the watch, that the wharfinger\n",
      "might snatch a few hours' sleep. There was no longer any danger of fire\n",
      "except from the conflagration itself, and now that the dynamiting had\n",
      "begun in earnest it was possible that the flames would be isolated\n",
      "before midnight.\n",
      "The Jap went off with the dish in one hand and a book in the other,\n",
      "hoping that he would be allowed to light a candle on the launch. He\n",
      "returned in a few moments, and for the first time he was smiling.\n",
      "\"Mr. Clatt will not give up his watch,\" he said. \"He says he might miss\n",
      "the chance to put a hole in some--dago (his language was very bad,\n",
      "Miss). He says there's not a wink of sleep in him.\"\n",
      "\"No doubt but that he will hold on to it, unless the military step in,\"\n",
      "said Anne. \"Then, I fancy, he would surrender very meekly. They have\n",
      "impressed a good many launches for prisoners and dynamite. But I hope\n",
      "not, for whether the fire comes up the hills or not, there is going to\n",
      "be terrible privation. Heaven knows how many days it will be before we\n",
      "have enough water even to drink, and I heard a little while ago that as\n",
      "soon as food comes in the authorities will establish relief stations,\n",
      "where everybody, from the millionaire to John Chinaman, will have to\n",
      "stand in line and wait for his loaf of bread. Wouldn't it be better for\n",
      "you to go at once?\"\n",
      "\"I fancy I can endure as much as any one, and if I am driven from here I\n",
      "will go down to you. I shall go down anyhow when I have seen Mr. Gwynne.\n",
      "I do not propose to lie in a hammock while several hundred thousand\n",
      "people are sleeping on the ground. What do you take me for?\"\n",
      "\"Somehow I don't see you as a nurse, or amusing children, or doling out\n",
      "bread and raiment. You would be much more in the picture encouraging Mr.\n",
      "Gwynne. However--I am going to impress your linen and a clothes-basket\n",
      "to carry it in. No doubt the philosophical Sugihara will help me carry\n",
      "it to the fort.\"\n",
      "\"Take what you like.\" Isabel directed her to the linen-closet, and went\n",
      "down to the veranda. She paused abruptly in the doorway. Victoria's face\n",
      "could be seen only in profile, but its expression, as she gazed down\n",
      "upon that tossing twisting furious flame ocean, needed no analytical\n",
      "faculty to interpret. It was voluptuous, ecstatic.\n",
      "Isabel crossed the porch in a stride.\n",
      "\"What are you thinking of?\" she demanded, imperiously.\n",
      "Victoria did not turn with a start. She did not turn at all. \"I am\n",
      "thinking,\" she replied, automatically, as if in obedience to the\n",
      "stronger will--\"I am thinking that at last I understand what it is we\n",
      "are so blindly striving for from the hour when we can think at all; what\n",
      "it is--that unsatisfied desire that urges us on and on to so many fatal\n",
      "experiments in the pursuit of happiness. The great goal, the real\n",
      "meaning of our miserable balked mortal existence is not that dancing\n",
      "will-o'-the-wisp we call happiness, for want of a better name. It is\n",
      "Death.\"\n",
      "\"Well?\" Isabel's voice rose, but she kept the anxiety out of it.\n",
      "\"I cannot imagine anything more delicious,\" went on Victoria, in the\n",
      "same low rich tones, \"than to walk straight down those hills and into\n",
      "that sea of flame. I have always admired Empedocles, who cast himself\n",
      "into Etna. Once I saw a friend cremated, and the brief vision of that\n",
      "white incandescence, before the coffin shot down, seemed to me the\n",
      "apotheosis, the voluptuous poetry of death. I could walk down into that\n",
      "colossal furnace without flinching, and I believe that my last moment,\n",
      "as the world disappeared behind me, and those superb flames took me into\n",
      "their embrace, would be one of sublimest ecstasy.\"\n",
      "Isabel caught her by the shoulders and whirled her about. \"Well, you\n",
      "will do nothing of the sort,\" she cried, roughly. \"In the first place you\n",
      "couldn't get through the lines, and in the second you are wanted at Fort\n",
      "Mason. Anne is going down with a basket of linen for the poor women who\n",
      "will be confined to-night. You are an uncommonly strong woman, and you\n",
      "can make use of every bit of your strength. Anne and the Leader are\n",
      "frail creatures, and no one else that I know of is going. They need you,\n",
      "and you will soon have your hands so full that your head will be purged\n",
      "of this nonsense. It is the fire lust--the same lust that incited a boy\n",
      "to-day to attempt to set fire to a house in this district that he might\n",
      "watch the whole city burn. I hope your egoism exploded in that climax.\n",
      "Here comes Anne. You must go.\"\n",
      "\"Very well,\" said Victoria, suddenly dazed, and with a will relaxed\n",
      "after the long tension of the day. \"I will go.\"\n",
      "\"Where are your jewels?\"\n",
      "\"Down in the bank.\"\n",
      "\"Well, gather up any other small things you treasure, and either conceal\n",
      "them about you or give them to me.\"\n",
      "\"I shall not take anything. My laces are in the chiffonniere. I do not\n",
      "care to enter the house again.\"\n",
      "Isabel fetched her hat and jacket, for in spite of the fire it would be\n",
      "cold near the water; and a few moments later she stood on the edge of\n",
      "Green and Jones streets, on the other side of the hill, and watched\n",
      "Victoria and Anne, carrying a large clothes-basket between them,\n",
      "carefully making their way down to the level. They had a walk of some\n",
      "thirteen blocks before them, but the streets were full of people and of\n",
      "ruddy light.\n",
      "She returned to the house and sat down on the porch, her eyes diverted\n",
      "from the fire for a moment by the picture of Sugihara, a pair of\n",
      "eye-glasses in front of his spectacles, comfortably established on a\n",
      "chair in the garden and reading by the lamp of the burning city. It was\n",
      "apparent that he had forgotten the 18th of April.\n",
      "Isabel was alone but a moment. Stone burst in upon her. He had\n",
      "approached from behind, and came running down the hill.\n",
      "\"Isabel,\" he cried. \"Get a bottle of champagne.\"\n",
      "\"Champagne?\"\n",
      "\"Yes. It may be six months before I see another--but that is a mere\n",
      "detail. I want to drink to the old city.\"\n",
      "Isabel, who liked him best in his dramatic moments, found a bottle of\n",
      "champagne. He knocked the head off, and filling the glass, went down to\n",
      "the first landing of the long narrow flight of steps. He held the glass\n",
      "high, pointing it first towards the middle of what had been Market\n",
      "Street, and was now a river of fire, then slowly shifting it along\n",
      "towards Kearney and Montgomery, as he named the restaurants that had\n",
      "given San Francisco no mean part of her fame.\n",
      "\"Here's to Zinkand's, Tait's, The Palace Grill! The Poodle Dog!\n",
      "Marchand's! The Pup! Delmonico's! Coppa's! The Fashion! The Hotel de\n",
      "France! And here's to the Cocktail Route, the Tenderloin, and the\n",
      "Bohemian Club! And here's--\" By this time his voice was dissolving, and\n",
      "the glass was describing eccentric curves. \"Here's to the old city,\n",
      "whose like will never be seen this side of hell again. Pretty good\n",
      "imitation of heaven in spots, and everything you chose to look for,\n",
      "anyway. And the prettiest women, the best fellows, the greatest\n",
      "all-night life, the finest cooking, the wickedest climate. Here's to San\n",
      "Francisco--and damn the bounder that calls her 'Frisco!\"\n",
      "Then he drank what was left of the contents of his glass and hastily\n",
      "refilled it. After he had finished the bottle luxuriously, he held out\n",
      "his hand to Isabel. \"Come along?\" he asked. Then, as she shook her head:\n",
      "\"I must go back to Paula and the kids. The mattresses are out in the\n",
      "Park already. You are in no danger, what with the neighbors above and\n",
      "the patrol. Good luck to you,\" and he vanished.\n",
      "Isabel was alone at last, a state she had unconsciously wished for all\n",
      "day--it seemed a month since the morning. She sat down and leaned her\n",
      "elbows on the railing. Now that the sun was gone, the heavens, or the\n",
      "smoke obscuring them, were as red as that sea beneath which seemed to\n",
      "devour a house a minute as it rolled out towards the Mission and worked\n",
      "with all its might among the great business blocks between Market Street\n",
      "and Telegraph Hill. Some one had estimated that the columns of fire\n",
      "were seven miles high, and they certainly looked as if they had melted\n",
      "the very stars. Here and there was a play of blue flames, doubtless from\n",
      "some explosive substance, and when the dynamite shot the entrails from a\n",
      "house there was a gorgeous display of fireworks--the golden showers of\n",
      "sparks symbolizing the treasure that blackened and crumbled in dropping\n",
      "back to earth.\n",
      "Before sitting down she had swept the distant hills with her field-glass\n",
      "and seen thousands of people lying not ten feet apart, like an exhausted\n",
      "army after battle. In that intense glare she could even study the\n",
      "eccentric positions of the fallen headstones and monuments in the old\n",
      "deserted cemeteries--Lone Mountain and Calvary. The cross on the lofty\n",
      "point of the bare hill behind the Catholic cemetery was red against the\n",
      "blackness of the west; and hundreds of weary mortals were huddled about\n",
      "its base. She tried to pity all those terrified uncomfortable creatures\n",
      "out there, but again the part they played in the greatest natural drama\n",
      "of modern times occurred to her, and she thought that should console\n",
      "them.\n",
      "She wondered at her lack of sentimental regret at the destruction of her\n",
      "beloved city. But sentiment seemed a mere drop of insult to be cast into\n",
      "that ocean of calamity. Moreover, she was pricked by a sense that it was\n",
      "a living sentient thing, that city, and was getting its just dues for\n",
      "the hearts it had devoured, the lives it had ruined, the merciless\n",
      "clutch it had kept upon so many that were made for better things. To its\n",
      "vice she gave little thought; she fancied it was not worse than other\n",
      "cities, if the truth were known; it was the picturesqueness of its\n",
      "methods that had held it in the limelight. But that it was one of the\n",
      "world's juggernauts, and the more cruel for its ever laughing beguiling\n",
      "face--of that there was no manner of doubt.\n",
      "She wondered also that she was not in a fever of anxiety about Gwynne.\n",
      "She had interrogated the sentry and been informed that the automobiles\n",
      "carrying dynamite dashed straight down to the fire line, often within;\n",
      "that a number of the soldiers, whose duty it was to lay the explosive,\n",
      "had been wounded and carried to the hospitals; that there was always the\n",
      "risk of a laden machine being suddenly surrounded by fire, for many\n",
      "houses were ignited by the sparks, and, in that wooden district down\n",
      "there, burned like tinder. Perhaps, like Victoria, she was too sure of\n",
      "his destiny; perhaps the picture of the future with him that she had\n",
      "conceived refused to alter its lines; or it may be that there was no\n",
      "place in the impersonal arrangement of her faculties the double\n",
      "catastrophe had effected, for fear; or for anything beyond the\n",
      "impressions of the moment. Her mind worked on mechanically. She was\n",
      "determined to remain as long as there was a possibility of Gwynne's\n",
      "returning for food or care. But the soul beneath was possessed by an\n",
      "absolute calm. She had the sense of having been taken into partnership\n",
      "with nature that morning; so sudden and personal had been that assault,\n",
      "from which she yet had issued unscathed. She felt that everything that\n",
      "would follow in life, excepting only her love for Gwynne, would be too\n",
      "petty to regard more seriously than the daily meals. Not that she had\n",
      "more than a bare mental appreciation of the phases of love at the\n",
      "moment; but it possessed her and it was infinite.\n",
      "She sat motionless until nearly two o'clock and then went up to her room\n",
      "and lay down. It was not possible to sleep for more than a few moments\n",
      "at a time, for the detonations were almost incessant, but she forced\n",
      "herself to rest, not knowing what work the morrow might have in store.\n",
      "When she finally rose and looked out of her window she saw that the fire\n",
      "was coming up the hills.\n",
      "XV\n",
      "She barely touched the breakfast prepared by the methodical Sugihara,\n",
      "who had already buried the silver, and cut the pictures from their\n",
      "frames, rolled, and tied them securely.\n",
      "\"It is only a question of a few hours,\" he said. \"The dynamiting so far\n",
      "has done more harm than good. They take a house at a time instead of a\n",
      "block, and as it falls apart it ignites another on the opposite side of\n",
      "the street. The army doesn't like to interfere, and the mayor has too\n",
      "long been obsequious to capital. Mr. Clatt is still there with the\n",
      "launch behind him. I took him down his breakfast some time ago. He told\n",
      "me to tell you that he'd 'got his job cut out for him now, as the Dagos\n",
      "were beginning to leave Telegraph Hill.'\"\n",
      "Isabel had one or two moments of panic as she watched those waves of\n",
      "flame beat up the hill, and pictured them raging up the eastern slopes\n",
      "as well; but the panic passed, for she knew that there were two exits\n",
      "still open. The heavens were black. A disk like a sealing-wax wafer\n",
      "indicated the position of the sun. The heat was terrific. The dynamiting\n",
      "was incessant, but it did not drown the roar and the eager furious\n",
      "crackle of the flames, the reverberating crash of falling walls. And the\n",
      "flames were the redder for the blackness above. Cinders were falling all\n",
      "over the heights, and the smoke burned the eyes.\n",
      "\"I shall feel like Casabianca presently, and rather ridiculous,\" she\n",
      "reflected, \"but I shall stay till the last possible moment.\" She went\n",
      "within and packed a pillow-case with Lady Victoria's laces and other\n",
      "portable objects of value and adornment, then gathered up similar\n",
      "belongings of her own, tied the case firmly about the neck, stood it\n",
      "where it could be snatched in flight, and returned to the porch.\n",
      "The boarding-house district, several blocks of large wooden houses,\n",
      "seemed literally to be swept from its foundations by those rushing\n",
      "pillars of fire. The whole quarter was wiped out in an hour, and then\n",
      "the fire turned its attention to the higher slopes.\n",
      "It played with them for a while, darting west and returning for a morsel\n",
      "at which it leaped with the agility of a living monster, went west\n",
      "again; then, its appetite whetted and its greed insatiable, it started\n",
      "straight for Nob Hill. The soldiers drove the faithful servants out of\n",
      "the houses at the point of the bayonet. Then--in a moment--the familiar\n",
      "curtains were blowing out of the windows--shrivelled to a crisp and\n",
      "pursued by the red rage behind.\n",
      "Sugihara did not go through the form of cooking luncheon. He knew that\n",
      "his mistress would not eat, and he had as little appetite himself. He\n",
      "folded his arms on the top of the fence and waited for the signal to\n",
      "retreat.\n",
      "Isabel went into the house repeatedly and dipped her burning face into a\n",
      "basin of water, but returned quickly to her post. The fire was running\n",
      "from the east along California Street hill; she saw the men who had been\n",
      "cutting pictures from their frames in the Institute of Art flee to the\n",
      "west, then watched the Gothic structure flare up and burn like an old\n",
      "hay-stack: that monument to a millionaire whose name would be already\n",
      "forgotten had it not been tacked to the gift. The fire reached\n",
      "California Street, on the edge of the plateau, from the south, coming up\n",
      "the west side of Taylor Street. Other great houses of the rich were so\n",
      "many roaring furnaces--several were curiously neglected and isolated by\n",
      "the fire, that seemed to have gone mad with its own lust. The eastern\n",
      "slopes were a mass of smouldering ruins, not black, but the most\n",
      "exquisite tints of violet, rose, chrome, gray, sepia, yellow. They\n",
      "looked, with their arches and columns, towers and broken walls, like the\n",
      "Roman Forum and the Palatine Hill on a colossal scale. About and through\n",
      "them floated clouds of fine white ashes, ghostly restless dust of\n",
      "unthinkable treasure.\n",
      "Suddenly, hardly crediting her eyes, Isabel saw an automobile labor up\n",
      "the steep acclivity, through that swirling furnace, and dart across\n",
      "California Street and in the direction of Russian Hill. She knew that\n",
      "Gwynne was in it, and a moment later Hofer discharged him at the foot of\n",
      "the steps, then ran the car out Jackson Street at the top of its speed.\n",
      "Gwynne walked up the steps and along the plank walk. Isabel recognized\n",
      "him by his carriage, for he was as black as a coal-heaver and most of\n",
      "his hair was burned off.\n",
      "\"I should like to wash first,\" he said, as he came up the house flight.\n",
      "\"The water will go with the rest.\"\n",
      "\"Of course. Do you want anything to eat.\"\n",
      "\"No, I had some sandwiches a while ago.\"\n",
      "He went up to his room and Isabel awaited him in the farthest corner of\n",
      "the living-room, where it may have been a trifle less hot and less noisy\n",
      "than elsewhere.\n",
      "He came down in a moment. \"That was a close shave,\" he said. \"We didn't\n",
      "know what we were in for, and it was either go on and hope for better\n",
      "luck at the top, or dive down into a very good imitation of a live\n",
      "volcano.\"\n",
      "He was recognizable, although his khaki clothes were black and burned,\n",
      "and one side of his head made him look as if he had just been discharged\n",
      "from a military hospital.\n",
      "\"I shall rest for a few moments and then go back,\" he said, throwing\n",
      "himself into a chair opposite Isabel. \"I never forgot you, but I made\n",
      "sure Stone had delivered my message and that you were on the ranch. I\n",
      "saw my mother and Miss Montgomery an hour ago. You must get out of this\n",
      "at once.\"\n",
      "\"Tell me what you have been doing,\" said Isabel evasively.\n",
      "\"I have been alive,\" he said, intensely. \"Never in all my days have I\n",
      "found life so wonderful. Battle is nothing to it. For the best part of\n",
      "two days I have been dodging the open jaws of death every minute; and\n",
      "the sensation of pitting one's puny human strength and the accumulated\n",
      "wit of several thousand years of varied civilization against an element\n",
      "in its might has inspired me with the only consummate approval of life\n",
      "that I have ever known--although I might have known it the day before\n",
      "yesterday if you had looked as you do now.\" He sat steadily regarding\n",
      "her for a few moments without speaking, but he was sensible of no\n",
      "immediate wish to touch her. That, too, belonged to a possibly greater\n",
      "but far different to-morrow. He was keyed very high. He did not feel\n",
      "himself so much a human being as a component part of one force disputing\n",
      "every inch of the progress of a mightier.\n",
      "\"Great God, what men!\" he burst out. \"I have been with some member of\n",
      "the Committee of Fifty, on and off, these two days, to say nothing of\n",
      "last night--Mr. Phelan invited me to serve on it yesterday morning. They\n",
      "are superb, not daunted for a moment, talking already of the new city,\n",
      "of the opportunity this conflagration has given them to make it over in\n",
      "every way. Architects were engaged before three o'clock yesterday\n",
      "afternoon. And the young business men that have been cleaned out! They\n",
      "talk only of the enormous possibilities of the future. I remember\n",
      "reading once of much the same spirit exhibited by Londoners after the\n",
      "Great Fire. It is the most wonderful thing in the world that for a few\n",
      "days at least you are permitted to cherish an unleavened respect for\n",
      "human nature. Every mean cowardly and selfish trait that chains man to\n",
      "earth is moribund to-day, in the normal at least; and the rats have run\n",
      "to other holes. The higher qualities, those that have inspired the world\n",
      "since it began, are in full possession. And, by Jove, it is going to be\n",
      "the pioneer life over again! Do you remember that I regretted once I\n",
      "could not be in at the foundation and growth of a great city, also that\n",
      "the drawback to such an opportunity was that one was never conscious of\n",
      "his part? Well, now we are back to the conditions of the Fifties, and we\n",
      "know it. We shall work for tremendous stakes, and in no doubt of the\n",
      "result.\"\n",
      "\"The enthusiastic moment has come,\" said Isabel.\n",
      "\"Rather. Here is my part cut out for me. Here I stay and become a chief\n",
      "factor in making this city greater even than before. That is enough for\n",
      "any man. And there will be plenty of fight. Politics will crawl back to\n",
      "new strongholds, as soon as men become egos again, but I shall fight\n",
      "them here, not in the country.\"\n",
      "He stood up, and Isabel asked, hastily: \"Have you had no sleep?\"\n",
      "\"Hofer and I broke into an empty house in the Western Addition towards\n",
      "morning and slept on the floor for three hours. I have known harder\n",
      "beds. I must go. I felt that I must look at you and order you to leave\n",
      "at once.\"\n",
      "\"I don't want to leave the city.\"\n",
      "\"You must go. The fire will have taken this house before midnight. You\n",
      "will be ordered out before that. They may save the city west of Van Ness\n",
      "Avenue, for the mayor at last has consented that several blocks shall be\n",
      "blown up at once. I am carrying dynamite. If I saw Russian Hill on fire\n",
      "and was not sure that you were out of harm's way, it would unnerve me,\n",
      "and I need all the nerve I've got.\"\n",
      "\"I can go down to Fort Mason.\"\n",
      "\"I want to know that you are out of the city. I think my mother is\n",
      "better off where she is. She is working with a will down there and\n",
      "absolutely refused to leave. I did not insist--no fire could cross those\n",
      "sand-lots, and I fancy she needs occupation. But you must go.\"\n",
      "\"I should be as safe.\"\n",
      "\"Perhaps. But I should be beset by fears that you had ventured too far.\n",
      "I can be quite impersonal, keen, steady of hand and brain, if you are\n",
      "out of the city.\"\n",
      "\"Very well, I will go.\"\n",
      "\"The day the fire is over I will go for you and we will marry and live\n",
      "in any shanty we can find--begin life together like any Forty-niners.\n",
      "You can help others as much as you choose then. There will be work for\n",
      "all--but now there is not, cannot be until organization begins. And I\n",
      "must be free to take care of you. Will you go at once? The launch is\n",
      "still there.\"\n",
      "\"Yes, I will go at once.\"\n",
      "He left her, and a few moments later she was walking down the other side\n",
      "of the hill, the voluminous pillow-case slung over her shoulder. Beside\n",
      "her trudged Sugihara, the ancestors under one arm, and his library under\n",
      "the other. The street along the water-front was a moving mass of\n",
      "refugees from Telegraph Hill, and Mr. Clatt was standing in the launch,\n",
      "on the alert. He gave a shout of delight as he saw Isabel, and she waved\n",
      "her hand. As she reached the wharf and forced her way through the\n",
      "Italians and Mexicans, who regarded her with no great favor, she noticed\n",
      "a small party of Chinese evidently in distress. The woman, magnificently\n",
      "arrayed, and hardly larger than a child, was huddled against the\n",
      "sea-wall, dumbly protesting that she could go no farther. Her face was\n",
      "twisted and her eyes were staring with pain and fright. A pretty child\n",
      "in three shirts of different colors, all silken and embroidered, was\n",
      "wailing in the common language of his years, and the young husband\n",
      "argued with his wife in vain: she made no response, but her passive\n",
      "resistance was as effective as if her feet had been six. She would not\n",
      "let her maid touch her, and her husband dared not relinquish his hold on\n",
      "his strong-box while surrounded by his formidable neighbors of Telegraph\n",
      "Hill.\n",
      "Isabel, glad to be able to do something for some one, told him to hand\n",
      "the box to Mr. Clatt, then carry his wife on board the launch. The nurse\n",
      "followed with the child, while Isabel and Sugihara, having cast their\n",
      "own burdens on board, and drawn their pistols, brought up in the rear.\n",
      "As the launch entered the current that would carry it east of Angel\n",
      "Island, Isabel looked at her guests--the Chinese wife and her child\n",
      "lying on the cushions of the cabin, stolid once more; the big-footed\n",
      "maid and the husband, his strong-box between his knees, seated opposite;\n",
      "the Japanese, sitting cross-legged on the roof, his back to the land--no\n",
      "doubt to emphasize his contempt for the rabble; Mr. Clatt, shaking his\n",
      "fist at a group of vociferating Italians--and smiled grimly as she\n",
      "recalled the romantic boat party that escaped from Pompeii. She did not\n",
      "feel in the least romantic, but she felt something greater and deeper.\n",
      "She turned her head many times to look at the wonderful spectacle of the\n",
      "burning city, the red curtain in the background, along whose front\n",
      "rushed the pillars of fire driven by the rolling masses of smoke. Where\n",
      "the fires on Nob Hill had burned low the flames looked like red\n",
      "sprouting corn. Fairmont had caught at last. It stood, a great square\n",
      "pile of white stone against the red background, and from its top alone\n",
      "poured a steady square volume of curling white smoke. The windows, and\n",
      "there were many hundreds of them, looked like plates of brass. The last\n",
      "thing she saw, as the launch shot up the bay towards San Pablo, was a\n",
      "wave of fire roll down Telegraph Hill, and hundreds of black pigmies\n",
      "fleeing before it.\n",
      "It was a beautiful evening of perfect peace when the launch entered\n",
      "Rosewater creek. The marsh was bathed in all the faint colors of the\n",
      "afterglow. The birds were singing. People were sitting under the trees\n",
      "in their parks or gardens. A fisherman was sailing up to Rosewater with\n",
      "his catch. But for the red light in the south and the faint sound as of\n",
      "a besieging army, there was nothing to recall that a civilization had\n",
      "been arrested and a great city was burning down to its bones.\n",
